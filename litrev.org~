#+TITLE: Evaluation of Pitch-Class Set Similarity Measures for Tonal Analysis
#+AUTHOR: Nicholas Harley

* Introduction
The objectives of the present work are principly concerned with
descriptive modelling of tonality using PC-set theory. In particular,
the analytical potential of set-class similarity measures will be
assessed and evaluated through comparison with similar work. The
tentetive goal, therefore, is to present this approach in such a way
as to make it relevant to the wider community of music researchers,
such as those in MIR.

Chapters [[Tonality]]-[[Spatial Models of Tonality]] comprise a literature
review containing backgroung information and some basic
theory. Chapter [[Tonality]] addresses the challenges and problems
involved in descriptive modelling of tonality as a means of
justification for the proposed approach. Chapter [[Pitch Class Set
Theory]] introduced the basic concepts of PC-set theory including
set-class similarity measures. Chapter [[Multidimensional Scaling]]
gives a basic description of MDS techniques and how they can play a
role in set-class analysis. Chapter [[Spatial Models of Tonality]]
contains a review of the relevant tonals models that exist so as to
give context work that follows.
* Tonality
** Defining Tonality
*** General Definition
Tonality is a notoriously complex musical phenomenon and numerous
definitions have been proposed from a variety of viewpoints. Perhaps
the most general definition is that provided by Hyer (cited in
\citealt{Martorell2013}): "... refers to the systematic arrangements
of pitch phenomena and relations between them". Explanations of
tonality have been provided through many different disciplines
(acoustics, music theory, linguistics, cognitive psychology) and a
detailed discussion of these areas is certainly beyond the scope of
this work. However, it is generally agreed that tonality is an
abstract cultural and cognitive contruct that can have many different
physical representations.
*** Babbitt's Domains
\citet{Babbitt1965} proposed three domains to categorise different
types of representation of music: acoustic (physical), auditory
(percieved), graphemic (notated). Western music theory provides a
lexicon for describing abstract tonal objects with terms such as note,
chord and key. These objects have a hierarchical relationship and the
meaning of these labels is highly dependent on musical context and the
scale of obsevation. Musicological descriptions, which constitute the
majority of reasoning about tonailty, reside mainly in the Babbitt's
graphemic domain, although arguably they refelct some aspects of the
other two. Each domain, whilst connected to every other, provides only
a projection of the musical whole and examination of tonality from
from just one type of description is unlikely to provide to ever be
complete. However, these three domains provide a convenient framework
for the discussion that follows.
** Modelling Tonality
The challenge of mathematically modelling aspects of tonality has been
approached in numerous ways and from differnt domains. In the
graphemic domain, musicologists and composers have proposed
theoretical models, attempting to rethink tonal theory from a
mathematical perspective. These models employ different branches of
mathematics such as geometry \citep{Tymoczko2012} or group theory
\citep{Ring2011} to describe harmonic structure. From the auditory
domain, cognitive psychologists have built models on tonal induction
based on preceptual ratings of tonal stimuli \citep{Krumhansl1990}.
*** Tonality as Context
Many models approach the concept of tonality as a context, within
which the relations and hierarchies of tonal phenomena can be
understood. A sense of tonality can be induced when musical stimuli
resembles some a priori contextual category. For western music of the
major-minor period, key signatures comprise a collection of categories
that give context to the tonal components of
music. \citet{Martorell2013} identifies three important aspects of
tonality as context: dimensionality (the relatedness of categories),
ambiguity (reference to two or more categories simultaneously) and
timing (the dynamics of tonal context). He highlights the importance
of a models capability to describe these aspects.
*** Tonality in MIR
The MIR community is primarily concerned with the extraction of tonal
descriptors from audio signals such as chord and key estimates. Most
systems use chroma features as a prelimiary step, obtained by mapping
STFT or CQ transform energies to chroma bins. Template matching is
used to compare the chroma vectors to a tonal model (contextual
category) using some distance measure. A commonly used tonal model for
key estimation are the KK-profiles \citep{Krumhansl1990} (used by
\citealt{Gomez2006}). Distance measures such as inner product (eg in
\citealt{Gomez2006}) and fuzzy distance (eg in \citealt{Purwins2000}) are
used to compare vectors. Statistical methods, such as HMMs, have been
used for chord and key tracking \citep{Chai2005}. Of addition
interest in the field is the concept of musical similarity (for music
recommendation, structure analysis and cover detection, for
example). \citep{Foote2000} computed self-similarity matrices for
visualisation of structure by correlating the MFCC feature vector
time-series. \citep{Gomez2006} proposed the application of this method
to tonal feature vectors.
*** Similarity
The importance of defining the similarity or closeness between musical
phenomena, be it theoretical, physical or perceptual, is central to
almost every model of tonality and often leads to a geometric
configuration tonal objects. The concept of similarity and distance is
discussed further in Chapter [[Spatial Models of Tonality]] where a review
of spatial models of tonality is given.
** The Semantic Gap
*** Acoustic Domain
\citep{Wiggins2009} discusses, what is refered to in MIR as, the
"Semantic Gap": the inability of systems to achieve success rates
beyond a conspicous boundary. He examines the fundamental
methodological groundings of MIR in terms of Babbitts three domains,
discussing the limits of each representation and regarding the
discarnate nature of music. He concludes that the audio signal
(acoustic domain) simply connot contain all of the information that
systems seek to retrieve. He points towards the the auditory domain as
the chief residence of music information and urges for in not to be
overlooked in MIR and wider music research.
*** Graphemic Domain
Furthermore, Wiggins criticises the purely graphemic approach and the
tendency of music research to presuppose musicological
axioms. \citep{Wiggins2012} argues that music (tonal) theory is,
rather than a theory in the scientific sense, a highly developed folk
psychology (internal human theory for explaining common
behaviour). Thus, the rules of music theory are not like scientific
laws but rather abstract descriptions of a specific musical
behavior. This idea challenges the validity of formalizing such rules
in mathematics and promts the question, "What is actually being
modelled?" He concludes that to apply mathematical models to muscial
output alone (scales or chords) without consideration of the musical
mind is a scientific failure.
*** Problems
The two assersions of Wiggins sit contrary to a number of the aspects
of the tonal models discussed in Chapter [[Modelling Tonality]]. Firstly,
the major-minor paradigm, upon which so many approaches are based,
whilst certainly possessing cognitive significance, is still a
musicological concept and therefore a misleading basis for both
mathematical and cognitive approaches. A second problem is that of the
numerical methods used by some MIR systems, in particular, distance
measures. As will be discussed in Chapter [[Spatial Models of Tonality]],
similary (and by extension distance) is a central part of the auditory
domain. MIR systems often uses distance measures from mathematics such
as Mahalanobis (\citep{Tzanetakis1999}) or Cosine (\citep{Foote2000})
with little consideration of their perceptual or musical significance.
** Systematicity
*** The Musical Surface
Having cautioned against a purely musicological approach,
\citet{Wiggins2009} proposes a compromise: to adopt a bottom-up
approach to music theory, exploring the concepts through systematic
mid-level representations. He states that "...methods starting at, for
example, the musical surface of notes is a useful way of
proceeding..." The concept of musical surface is illustrated by
\citet[pp. 159]{Huovinen2007} with a metaphore: "...to approach a
musical landscape not by drawing a map, which necessarily confines
itself to a limited set of structurally important features, but by
presenting a bird’s-eye view of the musical surface – an aerial
photograph, as it were, which details the position of every pitched
component." 
*** Systematic Description
\citep{Martorell2013} also advocates this mid-level approach,
observing that surface description influences analyitcal observation
and that, for an unbiased view, the researcher must be provided with
the adequate raw materials with which to make more indepth
observation. Such a systematic, descriptive model would be
fundamentally independent of high level concepts such as chords and
key but, at the same time, capable of capturing
them. \citep{Martorell2013} also disusses the importance of
systemasticity in terms of the dimensionality, ambiguity and
timing. He finds that models based on the major-minor paradigm are
incapable of adequately describing tonal ambiguity even in some
westerm music (\citep[chap. 3]{Martorell2013}).

With a systematic description of the musical surface, theories and
models from different domains can be gathered and evaluted together in
the same analytical arena, thus helping to bridge the gap between
traditional musicology, cognitive psycology and MIR.
* Pitch Class Set Theory
One such method availble for systematic description of the musical
surface is Pitch class set theory. PC-set theory is a system for
analysing the pitch content of music. It uses class equivelance
relations to reduce the ammount of data required to describe any
sequence of pitches.
** Pitch Class
Pitch-class set theory uses octave equivelance. A Pitch-Class (PC) is
a number indicating the position of a note within the octave. For
example, in western equal temperement (TET) the octave is divided in
to 12 steps. Each of these notes is given a number from 0-11.
#+CAPTION: Pitch classes
#+NAME: tab:pitch classes
| Note | C | C# | D | D# | E | F | F# | G | G# | A | A# |  B |
| PC   | 0 |  1 | 2 |  3 | 4 | 5 |  6 | 7 |  8 | 9 | 10 | 11 |
A PC-set is a collection of PCs ignoring any repetitions and the order
in which they occur. PC-sets are notated as follows {0,1,2,3,4} with
PCs ordered from lowest to highest as a convention.

#+NAME: tab:pcset
| Example 1: | PC-set | Pitch-set | S = {A4,C5,E5,A5} (A minor) |
|            |        | PC-set    | S = {9,0,4,9} = {0,4,9}     |

The cardinality of a set, denoted #S, is the number of PCs it
contains. There are 4096 (2^12) unique PC-sets and any segment of
music can be represented as a PC-set. Ignoring the octave, the order
of the notes and whether they occur simultaneously or in sequence
means PC-sets are abstract objects with many different musical
manifestations.
** Set Classification
Defining equivelance classes of PC-sets further reduces the total
number of tonal objects. A Set Class (SC) is a group of PC-sets
related by a transformation or group of transformations. The two types
of transformation commonly used are transposition and inversion. A
transposition, Tn(S), transposes the set S by the interval n (by
adding n to all PCs). An inversion, I(S), inverts the set S replacing
all PCs with their inverse (11-PC).
#+NAME: tab:transpostionandinversion
| Example 2: | Transposition | S = {0,4,9}, T3(S) = {3,7,0} = {0,3,7}  |
| Example 3: | Inversion     | S = {0,4,9}, I(S) = {11,7,2} = {2,7,11} |
From these two transformations it is possible to define three types of
SC: Tn, TnI and I, although I-types are not commonly used.
#+NAME: tab:sctypes
| Transpositional (Tn): | All PC-sets that can be transformed to each |
|                       | by transposition belong to the same class.  |
|                       | There are 348 distinct Tn types.            |
| Inversional (I):      | All PC-sets that can be transformed to each |
|                       | other by inversion belong to the same SC.   |
|                       | There are 197 distinct I types.             |
| Transpositional/      | All PC-sets that can be transformed to each |
| Inversional (TnI):    | other by transposition, inversion or both   |
|                       | belong to the same SC.                      |
|                       | There are 220 distinct TnI types.           |
The Prime Form of a PC-set is a convention for denoting the SC it
belongs to. The convention was introduced by Allan Forte for TnI
types and has since been adopted by the majority of theorists. In
addition he devised a system for ordering TnI-type SCs and assigning
to each one a number. For example, the Forte number 3-11 refers to the
11th SC of cardinality 3. This convension has been modified for use
with Tn types by adding A and B to the names of inversionally related
SCs.

One additional concept is that of cardinality class (nC) which refers
to all the SCs of cardinality n. Cardinality class 2 is commonly
refered to as Interval class (IC). There are 6 distinct intervall
classes.

** Vector Analysis
*** Membership and Inclusion
Two concepts that are crucial in PC-set theory are Membership and
Inclusion. Membership of a set is denoted p \in S and means that PC p
is a member of set S. Inclusion in a set is denoted Q \subset S and
means that all members of Q are also members of set S. Q is said to be
a subset of S.
#+NAME: tab:membershipandinclusion
| Example 4: | Membership | 4 $\in$ {0,4,9}               |
| Example 5: | Inclusion  | {0,4,9} $\subset$ {0,1,4,5,9} |
*** Embedding Number
\citep{Lewin1979} applied these concepts to SCs to develop his
Embedding Number, EMB(X,Y). Given two SCs, X and Y, EMB(X,Y) is the
number of instances of SC X which are included in (are subsets of) SC
Y.
#+NAME: tab:embeddingnumnber
| Example 6: | Embedding Number | X = {0,4} and Y = {0,4,8} |
|            |                  | so EMB(X,Y) = 3           |
*** Subset Vectors
An n-class subset vector of X, nCV(X), is an array of values of
EMB(A,X) where A is each of the SCs in the cardinality class nC. The
Interval-Class Vector (ICV) is a special instance of the nCV with n
equal to 2.
#+NAME: tab:subsetvector
| Example 7: | Subset Vector | S = {0,4,9}                     |
|            |               | 2CV(X) = ICV(X) = [0 0 1 1 1 0] |
Subset vectors forms the basis of the majority of analysis performed
by PC-set theorists. In addition, many theorists have proposed
modifications to the basic nCV to suit their specific purposes and
some of these modifications will be discussed in context where
necessary.
** PC-Set Similarity
*** Similarity Relations
The assessment of similarity between SCs has been discussed in the
literature for decades and a large number theoretical models have been
proposed. Different models approaches the problem from different
conceptual standpoints and theorists have different opinions about the
contributing factors. All these models are described under the blanket
term "similarity relations". Despite the perennial fascination with
the concept, little or no concensus exits as to what constitutes a
good similarity relation.

\citep{Castren1994} provides a comprehensive and indepth review of a
large number of similarity relations and categorises them according to
some fundamental principles. Firstly he distinguishes between methods
that produce binary outcomes and those that produce a range of
values. The former category, termed "Plain Relations", include Forte's
R-relations (citep{Forte1973}) and indicate whether the two SCs are
related in a specific way, which in turn may give some indication of
whether they are similar. The latter category, termed "similarity
measures", indicate a degree of similarity, returning a value from a
known range. This property appears to be more inline with the
perceptual notion of similarity and therefore the focus of this work
shall be exclusively on similarity measures.
*** Similarity Measures
The vast number and diversity of the different approachs to similarity
measures can only be approached by norrowing the focus to a specific
type. Here we will focus on measures that use the Tn and TnI-type SCs
([[Set Classification]]), and futhermore we will only consider those
methods based on vector analysis ([[Vector Analysis]]). These measure
usually involve the comparison of the SC's nCVs. Of this (still
sizable) subset, \citep{Castren1994} identifies two main categories.
#+NAME: tab:measuretypes
| Single nC:      | Single nC measures compare the nCVs of the two SCs for |
|                 | one particular value of n. Many of the relations in    |
|                 | this category compre the ICVs (2CVs).                  |
| Total Measures: | Total Measures consider the subsets of all             |
|                 | cardinalities contained within in two SCs. All the     |
|                 | relevant nCVs are compared to produce a final value.   |

Table 4 shows the majority of the Tn and TnI-Type, vector based
similarity measures from the PC-set theoretical literature. Vector
Type indicates whether the measure compares ICVs or nCVs. Card
(Cardinality) indicates whether the measure is capable of comparing
SCs of different cardinalities while the Measure Type indicates which
of Castren's categories it belongs to. nC indicates it is a Single nC
measure and TOTAL indicates it is a Total Measure. All these measure
are described more thouroughly in Appendix ??? (NOT INCLUDED IN
LITERATURE REVIEW).

*** Castrens Criteria
In addtion to his categorisation, \citep{Castren1994} proposes several
criteria which a good similarity relation should meet. Later, these
criteria will be used in assessing the specific capabilities of
various similarity measures. Castren says that a similarity measure
should:

- C1: allow comparisons between SCs of different cardinalities
- C2: provide a distinct value for every pair of SCs
- C3: provide a comprehensible scale of values such that
  - C3.1: All values are commensurable
  - C3.2: the end points are not just some extreme values but can be
    meaningfully associated with maximal and minimal similarity.
  - C3.3: The values are integers or other easily managable numbers
  - C3.4: the degree of discrimination is not too coarse and not
    unrealistically fine
- C4: produce a uniform value for all comparable cases
- C5: observe mutually embeddable subset-classes of all meaningful
  cardinalities
- C6: observe also the mutual embeddable subset-classes not in common
  between the SCs being compared.
** Perceptual relevance
PC-set theory offers a highly abstract describtion of musical objects
and thus, an important question to be asked is whether the many class
equivelance relations and the theoretical models of similarity used
reflect perceptual equivelance. Here some relevant sudies are
discussed.
*** Octave equivelance
Pitch is a percept that derives from a particular harmonic structure
and is roughly proportional to the logarithm of the fundamental
frequency. This allows pitch to be modelled as a straight line, finite
at both ends. Music psychologists have observed a strong perceptual
similarity between pitches with fundamental frequencies in the ratio
of 2:1. This property of octave similarity leads the straight line
model of pitch to be bent into a helix. Division of the octave into a
number of categories is thought to offer a more effecient cognitive
representation in memory and thus confers evolutionary advantage. The
resulting pitch equivelance classes are implicitly learned through
exposure at an early age. TET has 12 pitch equivelance classes which
in PC-set theory are modelled as a circular projection of the pitch
helix. Thus the two most fundamental compents of PC-set theory,
i.e. octave equivelance and pitch-class labelling, would appear to
have a solid basis in percepton.

\citep{Gibson1988} investigated the percieved similarity of pairs of
chords with varying numbers of octave related pitches. He found that
in general chords with identical PC contents were percieved as more
similar than chords with near identicle PC contents, reguardless of
the octave. However, in further studies he his findings suggest that
there are other factors that play a significant role
(\citep{Gibson1993}).
*** Set-Class Equivelance
Some researchers have attempted to examine whether there is percieved
equivelance between different manifestations of a
PC-set. \citep{KrumhanslSandell1987} presented subjects with sequences
of tones derived by transforming two different PC-sets. They noted
that subjects were able to distinguish between the different sets both
in neutral and musical contexts.  

\citep{Millar1984} investigated the peceptual similarity of different
PC-sets derived from the same set class under TnI
classification. Subjects were presented with 3 note melodies and asked
to judge which was equivelant to a reference melody. Some melodies
preserved the SC identity whilst others did not. She found
transpositions to be percieved more similar than inversions and in
addition he descovered that the order of the notes and melodic contour
was a strong factor in perceived similarity.

Some authors have questioned the perceptual relevance of using TnI
equivelance as a basis for set classification. \citep{Deutsch1982}
seems unconvinced by evidence for the perceptual similarity of
inverted intervals. This can be illustrated by the example of major
and minor triads which, while perceptually distinct, are equivelant
under TnI.
*** Percieved vs Theoretical Similarity
A number of studies have been done to acertain the connection between
perceptual similarity ratings and the theoretical values obtained from
some PC-set similarity measures. A large number of relevant studies
are summarised by \citep{Kuusi2001} and the most significant ones are
mentioned here.

\citep{Bruner1984} used multidimensional scaling on subjects'
similarity ratings between trichords and tetrachords and on the
similarity values obtained from SIM (\citep{Morris1979}). She compared
the 2-dimensional solutions and found there to be little correlation.

\citep{Gibson1986} investigated non-traditional chords. He compared
subjects' ratings with similarity assessments calculated from Forte's
R-relations (\citep{Forte1973}) and Lord's similarity function
(\citep{Lord1981}). He also concluded there was little correspondence
between the two.

\citep{Stammers1994} compared subjects' ratings of 4 note melodes with
the theoretical values obtained from SIM (\citep{Morris1979}). She
found the ratings of subjects with more musical training to be more
correlated with the SIM values.

\citep{Lane1997} compared subjects' ratings of pitch sequences with
corresponding values of seven ICV-based similarity measures: ASIM,
MEMB2, REL2, s.i., IcVSIM and AMEMB2 and concluded there to be a
strong relation.

\citep{Kuusi2001} compared subjects' ratings of pentachords with the
values obtained from 9 similarity measures. He found there to be a
connection between aurally estimated ratings and the theoritcal values
and concluded that the abstract properties of set-classes do have some
perceptual relevance. He also comments on the way in which this kind
of study is conducted, suggesting that the way in which subjects are
presented with the stimuli has a significant effect on the outcome.
** PC-set Theory for Analysis
PC-set theory as means for descriptive modelling of tonality is not
widley known outside of highly theoretical circles and the use of
PC-set similarity measures seems mainly restricted to the theorists
who propsed them (for example, \citep{Isaacson1996}). The basic
premise is simple: a musical piece is segmented and each segment
described by its SC. Similarity measures can be used to assess the
similarity between segments or between a segment and some reference
SC.

\citet{Huovinen2007} used a pentachordal tail segmentation policy
(each successive note defines a segment that also includes the
preceeding 4 notes) and compared these segments to comparison sets 7-1
(chromaticism) and 7-35 (diatonicism) using the REL distance. They
claim that the visual results of their analysis "reflect pertinent
aspects of our listening experience" (\citep[pp. 204]{Huovinen}).

\citep[chap. 5.3]{Martorell2013} uses a more systematic approach to
segmentation using multiple time scales. He proposes the class-scape,
a two-dimensional visualisation of a piece of music with time on the
x-axis and segmentation time-scale on the y-axis. A single SC can be
represented by highlighting the segment or alternatively each segment
can be shaded acording to its REL distance from a comparison SC. He
emphasises that class-scape and other tool are explorotary tools
rather than an automated analysis system.
* Multidimensional Scaling
Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a numerical visualisation technique
that, given a matrix of pairwise distances between objects, provides a
geometric configuration of the objetcs in some abstract space. It
provides an efficient means of observing relationships in large,
complex data sets and the resulting dimensions often give valuable
insight into the data as a whole.
** Non-Metric MDS
Non-Metric MDS was described by \citep{Shepard1962} and it assumes
that the distance matrix values are related to points in an abstrat
N-dimensional Euclidean space. An important consideration is that of
the dimensionality of the solution. For comprehension and
visualisation it is important to minimise the number of dimensions
however, there is a trade of between the number of dimensions and the
accuracy of the model. For a given dimensionality, we obtain two
values: Stress and r^2.
#+NAME: tab:stressr2
| Stress | Stress is a "goodness of fit" measure which characterises   |
|        | the distortion that occurs in a given number of dimensions. |
|        | As the number of dimensions increases the stress decreases. |
| $r^2$  | $r^2$ is the percentage variability of the data being       |
|        | explained by the solution                                   |
By plotting stress against r^2 for a number of dimensionalities is
possible to obsever the point at which additional dimensions do not
improve the solution (the "elbow"). Ultimately, the choice of
dimensions should be based on interpretation.
** Cluster Analysis
Cluster Analysis (CA) is method for dealing with dimensions that are
highly seperable. First, the most similar pair of objetcs are selected
and grouped together in a cluster. The process is repeated, creating a
binary tree structure. The distance between objects is then related to
their separation along the branches of the tree.
** MDS with Similarity Measures
Using MDS on the values produced by similarity measures is one way to
approach an understanding of the constricts they are measuring. There
are two potentially interesting issues to consider. Firstly, a measure
may be inconsistent with itself, meaning that the geometries it
produces are not "robust" (changing the set of objects changes the
distances between the original set). This kind of problem cannot be
observed through inspection of the values alone. The second issue is
that two different measures that are both self-consistent may produce
very different geometries from the same group of SCs. The question then
is, what exaclty do the measures measure?
* Spatial Models of Tonality
** Similarity and Distance
Judgements of similarity form the basis of many cognitive processes
including the perception of tonality. Similarity between two objects
is often concieved as being inversly related to distance between them
in geometric space. For example, some tonal objects (chords, for
example) are percieved as close to one another whereas others are
further apart. In addition, the number of dimensions of the geometric
space is in connection with the number of independent properties that
are relevant for similarity comparisons. \citep{Gardenfors1995}
suggests that humans are naturally predisposed to create spatial
cognitive representations of percetual stimulai due to the geometric
nature of the world we have evolved to inhabit. Therefore spatial
modelling of tonalilty, as well as helping to visualise the complex
multidimenstional relationships between tonal phenomena, has the
potential to refelct cognitive aspects of the way they are percieved.
** Spatial Representations
Throughout history theorists have proposed many spatial
representations of tonality from different domains. From the graphemic
domain, \citep{Heinichen1728}, \citep{Webber} and \citep{Schoenberg}
all proposed simple 2-dimensional charts to display the proximity
between keys. For representation of chords, \citep{Riemann} models
major and minor triads as regions in a 2-dimensional space whilst
\citep{Tymoczko2011} propeses a vaireiety high dimensional,
non-euclidean chord spaces that reflect the theoretical principles of
voice leading. From the acoustic domain, \citep{Shepard1982} proposes
a five-dimensional model to represent interval relations between
pitches. Some theorists have attepted encorporate relations between
several levels of tonal hierarchy into one configuration. The "spiral
array" of \citep{Chew2000a} is a three-dimensional mathematcal model
which simulataneously captures the relations between pitches, chords
and keys. The chordal-regional space of \citep{Lerdahl2001} models the
relations between chords within a certain key.
** Cognitive Psychology
The auditory domain has been addressed through congnitive psychology
by \citep{Krumhansl1990} who used the probe-tone methodology
(\citep{Krumhansl1979}) to establish major and minor key profiles (12
dimensional vectors containing the perceptual stability ratings of
each of the 12 pitch classes within a major or minor context). These
profiles, know as Krumhansl-Kessler profiles (KK-profiles), show the
hierarchy of pitches in major and minor keys. Correlating each of the
24 major and minor profiles produced a matrix of pairwise distances
which was fed to a dimensional scaling algorithm. The resulting
geometrical solution was found to have a double circular property
(circle of fifths and relative-parallel relations) which can be
modelled as the surface a 3D torus. Many spatial models of tonality
have this double circular property whether it is implicit
(\citep{Weber,Schoenberg}) or stated explicitly
(\citep{Lerdahl2001a}).
** Set-Class Spaces
Most of these models are limited to description of music in the
major-minor paradigm and are not capable of generalirzing beyond the
"western common practice". PC-set theory, once again, provides a
possible means to generalise to any kind of pitch-based music. By
considering a collection of tonal objects described by SCs, a
geometric space can be contructued to model their relations based on
some theoreitcal principle. Some PC-set theorists have proposed
explicit geomtric spaces to model relations between SCs. The distances
in these spaces are expressed by models of similarity based on voice
leading (\citep{Cohn2003,Tymoczko2012}) or ICVs and the Fourier
transform (\citep{Quinn2006, Quinn2007}). However, these models are
only designed to represent SCs of one cardinality class at a time and
cannot model the relation between any collection of pitches.

Alternative spatial models are provided by the implicit geometries of
the values produced by the SC similarity measures discussed in [[PC-Set
Similarity]]. Multidimensional scaling can be used on values produced by
similarity measure to create a geometric
configuration. \citep{Kuusi2001} and \citep{Samplaski2005} both
applied MDS to the values produced from a variety of similarity
measures. Samplaski used TnI-type SCs while Kuusi used Tn-type. They
both found reasonably low-dimensional solutions and attempted to
interpret each of the dimensions. Kuusi interpreted 3 dimensions as
corresponding to chrotaticism, wholetoneness and
pentatonicism. Samplaski made similar observations but found some
dimensions in the higher-dimensional spaces difficult to interpret.
Nevertheless, he concluded that values from similarity measure tend to
agree (with some exceptions) and that they measure constructs relating
to familiar scales (diatonic, hexatonic, octatonic, etc.).
