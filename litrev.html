<p>This work explores the limitations of exiting approaches to
computational modelling and description of tonality.
</p>
<p>
PC-set theory is presented as alternative or complement to existing
approaches.
</p>
<p>
The methodology emphasised systematicity and perceptual relevance.
</p>
<p>
SC similarity is presented as tool for aiding in the representation of
SC information.
</p>
<p>
A survey of SC similarity measures is conducted.
</p>
<p>
Systematic SC descriptions of specific examples are represented
through techniques rovolving around SC similarity.
</p>
<p>
The analytical potential of the techniques is evidenced in the

<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>The objectives of the present work are principally concerned with
descriptive modelling of tonality using PC-set theory. In particular,
the analytical potential of set-class similarity measures will be
assessed and evaluated through comparison with similar work. The
tentative goal, therefore, is to present this approach in such a way
as to make it relevant to the wider community of music researchers,
such as those in MIR.

<h3 id="sec-2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Problem</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">

<ol>
<li>Existing computational description of tonality is often limited in
   its scope.
</li>
<li>The predominant use of template matching for chord and key
   estimations limits the knowledge of music-capable systems to
   repertoire of the major-minor paradigm. This narrow view of
   tonality is insufficient for even some western music.
</li>
<li>The predominant use of non-musical similarity measures in MIR such
   as Euclidean distance and correlation seems counter-intuitive in
   many cases.
</li>
<li>The above may be contributing to the "semantic gap".

<h3 id="sec-2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Objectives</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">

<ol>
<li>To adopt a systematic approach to description of tonality.
</li>
<li>To justify set class analysis as a systematic descriptive tool,
   capable of relating useful musical information as well as having a
   degree of perceptual relevance.
</li>
<li>To position set class analysis among existing methods of tonal
   description such as chroma vector time-series.
</li>
<li>To create a comprehensive and practical survey of set class
   similarity measures.
</li>
<li>To examine the measures in terms of systematicity and perceptual
   relevance.
</li>
<li>To develop techniques for the representation of set class
   information so as to expose meaningful musicological information.
</li>
<li>To utilise set class similarity in these representation.
</li>
<li>To evaluate the utility of these similarity measures through
   exploration of SC information to extract a priori knowledge about
   specific pieces. The analytical potential of the model will be
   evidenced through specific analysis examples.

<p>Chapters <a href="#sec-3">Tonality</a>-<a href="#sec-6">Spatial Models of Tonality</a> comprise a literature
review containing background information and some basic
theory. Chapter <a href="#sec-3">Tonality</a> addresses the challenges and problems
involved in descriptive modelling of tonality as a means of
justification for the proposed approach. Chapter <a href="#sec-4">Pitch-Class Set Theory</a> introduces the basic concepts of PC-set theory including
set-class similarity measures. Chapter <a href="#sec-5">Multidimensional Scaling</a> gives
a basic description of MDS techniques and how they can play a role in
set-class analysis. Chapter <a href="#sec-6">Spatial Models of Tonality</a> contains a
review of the relevant tonal models that exist so as to give context
work that follows. Chapter <a href="#sec-7">Similarity Measure Selection</a> evaluates the
similarity measures from the literature in terms of some specific
criteria and in doing so a subset of measures are selected for further
investigation. Chapter <a href="#sec-8">Total Measures</a> examines this subset of measures
more closely and comparisons are made. Chapter <a href="#sec-9">Segmentation</a> outlines
the segmentation techniques required for a systematic description of a
piece while Chaprer <a href="#sec-10">Visualisation</a> presents three techniques for
representing this data for the extraction of meaningful musical
information. Chapters <a href="#sec-10-4">Conclusions</a> and <a href="#sec-13">Future Work</a> present the
conclusions and discussion of future work respectively.

<p>Tonality is a notoriously complex musical phenomenon and numerous
definitions have been proposed from a variety of viewpoints. Perhaps
the most general definition is that provided by \citet{Hyer2013}:
"&hellip; refers to the systematic arrangements of pitch phenomena and
relations between them." Explanations of tonality have been provided
through many different disciplines (acoustics, music theory,
linguistics, cognitive psychology) and a detailed discussion of these
areas is certainly beyond the scope of this work. However, it is
generally agreed that tonality is an abstract cultural and cognitive
construct that can have many different physical representations.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-2">

<p>\citet{Babbitt1965} proposed three domains to categorise different
types of representation of music: acoustic (physical), auditory
(perceived), graphemic (notated). Western music theory provides a
lexicon for describing abstract tonal objects with terms such as note,
chord and key. These objects have a hierarchical relationship and the
meaning of these labels is highly dependent on musical context and the
scale of observation. Musicological descriptions, which constitute the
majority of reasoning about tonaility, reside mainly in the Babbitt's
graphemic domain, although arguably they reflect some aspects of the
other two. Each domain, whilst connected to every other, provides only
a projection of the musical whole and examination of tonality from
just one will most likely result in an incomplete picture. However,
these three domains provide a convenient framework for the discussion
that follows.

<p>The challenge of mathematically modelling aspects of tonality has been
approached in numerous ways and from different domains. In the
graphemic domain, musicologists and composers have proposed
theoretical models, attempting to rethink tonal theory from a
mathematical perspective. These models employ different branches of
mathematics such as geometry \citep{Tymoczko2012} or group theory
\citep{Ring2011} to describe harmonic structure. From the auditory
domain, cognitive psychologists have built models of tonal induction
based on perceptual ratings of tonal stimuli \citep{Krumhansl1990}.

<p>Many models approach the concept of tonality as a context, within
which the relations and hierarchies of tonal phenomena can be
understood. A sense of tonality can be induced when musical stimuli
resemble some a priori contextual category. For western music of the
major-minor period, key signatures comprise a collection of categories
that give context to the tonal components of
music. \citet{Martorell2013} identifies three important aspects of
tonality as context: dimensionality (the relatedness or "closeness" of
categories), ambiguity (reference to two or more categories
simultaneously) and timing (the dynamics of tonal context). He
highlights the importance of a models capability to describe these
aspects.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-2-2">

<p>The MIR community is primarily concerned with the extraction of tonal
descriptors from audio signals such as chord and key estimates. Most
systems use chroma features as a preliminary step, obtained by mapping
STFT or CQ transform energies to chroma bins. Template matching is
used to compare the chroma vectors to a tonal model (contextual
category) using some distance measure. A commonly used tonal model for
key estimation are the KK-profiles \citep{Krumhansl1990} (<a href="#sec-6-3">Cognitive Psychology</a>) (e.g. in \citealt{Gomez2006}). Distance measures such as
inner product (e.g. in \citealt{Gomez2006}) and fuzzy distance
(e.g. in \citealt{Purwins2000}) are used to compare
vectors. Statistical methods, such as HMMs, have been used for chord
and key tracking \citep{Chai2005}. Of addition interest in the field
is the concept of musical similarity (for music recommendation,
structure analysis, cover detection etc.). \citet{Foote2000} computed
self-similarity matrices for visualisation of structure by correlating
the MFCC feature vector time-series. \citet{Gomez2006} proposed the
application of this method to tonal feature vectors.

beyond a conspicuous boundary. He examines the fundamental
methodological groundings of MIR in terms of Babbitts three domains,
discussing the limits of each representation and regarding the
discarnate nature of music. He concludes that the audio signal
(acoustic domain) simply cannot contain all of the information that
systems seek to retrieve. He points towards the the auditory domain as
the chief residence of music information and urges for in not to be

rather than a theory in the scientific sense, a highly developed folk
psychology (internal human theory for explaining common
behaviour). Thus, the rules of music theory are not like scientific
laws but rather abstract descriptions of a specific musical
behaviour. This idea challenges the validity of formalising such rules
in mathematics and prompts the question, "What is actually being
modelled?" He concludes that to apply mathematical models to musical
output alone (scales or chords) without consideration of the musical
mind is a scientific failure.

<p>The two assertions of Wiggins sit contrary to a number of the aspects
of the tonal models discussed in <a href="#sec-3-2">Modelling Tonality</a>. Firstly, the
major-minor paradigm, upon which so many approaches are based, whilst
certainly possessing cognitive significance, is still a musicological
concept and therefore a misleading basis for both mathematical and
cognitive approaches. A second problem is that of the numerical
methods used by some MIR systems, in particular, distance measures. As
will be discussed in Chapter <a href="#sec-6">Spatial Models of Tonality</a>, similarity
(and by extension distance) is a central part of the auditory
domain. MIR systems often uses distance measures from mathematics such
as Mahalanobis \citep{Tzanetakis1999} or Cosine \citep{Foote2000} with
little consideration of their perceptual or musical significance.

<p>Having cautioned against a purely musicological approach,
\citet[pp. 481]{Wiggins2009} proposes a compromise: to adopt a
bottom-up approach to music theory, exploring the concepts through
systematic mid-level representations. He states that "methods
starting at, for example, the musical surface of notes is a useful way
of proceeding" The concept of musical surface is illustrated by
\citet[pp. 159]{Huovinen2007} with a metaphor: "&hellip;to approach a
musical landscape not by drawing a map, which necessarily confines
itself to a limited set of structurally important features, but by
presenting a bird’s-eye view of the musical surface – an aerial
photograph, as it were, which details the position of every pitched

<p>\citet{Martorell2013} also advocates this mid-level approach,
observing that surface description influences analyitcal observation
and that, for an unbiased view, the researcher must be provided with
the adequate raw materials with which to make more in-depth
observation. Such a systematic, descriptive model would be
fundamentally independent of high level concepts such as chords and
key but, at the same time, capable of capturing
them. \citet{Martorell2013} also discusses the importance of
systematicity in terms of dimensionality, ambiguity and timing. He
finds that models based on the major-minor paradigm are incapable of
adequately describing tonal ambiguity even in some Western music
\citep[chap. 3]{Martorell2013}.
</p>
<p>
With a systematic description of the musical surface, theories and
models from different domains can be gathered and evaluated together in
the same analytical arena, thus helping to bridge the gap between
traditional musicology, cognitive psychology and MIR.

PCs ignoring any repetitions and the order in which they
occur. PC-sets are notated as follows {0,1,2,3,4} with PCs ordered
from lowest to highest as a convention (Example 1). The cardinality of
a set, denoted #S, is the number of PCs it contains (Example 2). There
are 4096 (2<sup>12</sup>) unique PC-sets with which any segment of music can be

<p>Defining equivalence classes of PC-sets further reduces the total
number of tonal objects. A set-class (SC) is a group of PC-sets
related by a transformation or group of transformations. The two types
of transformation commonly used are transposition and inversion. A
transposition, Tn(S), transposes the set, S, by the interval, n, (by
adding n to all PCs, Example 3). An inversion, I(S), inverts the set
S, replacing all PCs with their inverse (12-PC, Example 4). From these
two transformations it is possible to define three types of SC: Tn,
TnI and I.

The Prime Form of a PC-set is a convention for denoting the SC it
belongs to. The convention was introduced by Allan Forte
\citep{Forte1973} for TnI types and has since been adopted by the
majority of theorists. In addition, he devised a system for ordering
TnI-type SCs and assigning to each one a cardinality-ordinal
number. For example, the Forte number 3-11 refers to the 11th SC of
cardinality 3. This convention has been modified for use with Tn types
by adding A and B to the names of inversionally related SCs.
</p>
<p>
One additional concept is that of cardinality-class (nC), which refers
to all the SCs of cardinality n. Cardinality-class 2 is commonly
referred to as interval-class (IC) and there are 6 distinct
interval-classes.

</p>
<p>
\citet{Castren1994} provides a comprehensive and in-depth review of a
large number of similarity relations and categorises them according to
some fundamental principles. Firstly, he distinguishes between methods
that produce binary outcomes and those that produce a range of
values. The former category, termed "plain relations", include Forte's
R-relations \citep{Forte1973} and indicate whether the two SCs are
related in a specific way, which in turn may give some indication of
whether they are similar. The latter category, termed "similarity
measures", indicate a degree of similarity, returning a value from a
known range. This property appears to be more inline with the
perceptual notion of similarity and therefore the focus of this work
shall be exclusively on similarity measures.

Castren says that a similarity measure should:

<li>C1: allow comparisons between SCs of different cardinalities
</li>
<li>C2: provide a distinct value for every pair of SCs
</li>
<li>C3: provide a comprehensible scale of values such that
<ul>
<li>C3.1: All values are commensurable
</li>
<li>C3.2: the end points are not just some extreme values but can be
    meaningfully associated with maximal and minimal similarity.
</li>
<li>C3.3: The values are integers or other easily manageable numbers
</li>
<li>C3.4: the degree of discrimination is not too coarse and not
    unrealistically fine

</li>
<li>C4: produce a uniform value for all comparable cases

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-5">

<p>The many equivalence relations used in PC-set theory give rise to a
highly abstract description of musical objects. Thus, an important
question to be asked is whether these theoretical assumptions and
models of similarity reflect perceptual equivalence. This chapter
contains a summary and discussion of some relevant studies.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-4-5-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-5-1"><span class="section-number-4">4.5.1</span> Octave Equivalence</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-5-1">

<p>Pitch is a percept that derives from a particular harmonic structure
and is roughly proportional to the logarithm of the fundamental
frequency. This allows pitch to be perceptually modelled as a straight
line. Music psychologists have observed a strong perceptual similarity
between pitches with fundamental frequencies in the ratio of 2:1. This
property of octave similarity leads the straight line model of pitch
to be bent into a helix. Division of the octave into a number of
categories is thought to offer a more efficient cognitive
representation in memory and thus confers evolutionary advantage. The
resulting pitch equivalence classes are implicitly learned through
exposure at an early age. TET has 12 pitch equivalence classes which,
in PC-set theory, are modelled as a circular projection of the pitch
helix. Thus the two most fundamental components of PC-set theory,
i.e. octave equivalence and pitch-class labelling, would appear to
have a solid basis in perception.
</p>
<p>
\citet{Gibson1988} investigated the perceived similarity of pairs of
chords with varying numbers of octave related pitches. He found that
in general chords with identical PC contents were perceived as more
similar than chords with near identical PC contents, regardless of the
octave of the pitch components. However, in further studies he his
findings suggest that there are other factors that play a significant
role \citep{Gibson1993}.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-5-2">

<p>Some researchers have attempted to examine whether there is perceived
equivalence between different manifestations of a
PC-set. \citet{KrumhanslSandell1987} presented subjects with sequences
of tones derived by transforming two different PC-sets. They noted
that subjects were able to distinguish between the different sets both
in neutral and musical contexts.  
</p>
<p>
\citet{Millar1984} investigated the perceptual similarity of different
PC-sets derived from the same set class under TnI
classification. Subjects were presented with three-note melodies and
asked to judge which was equivalent to a reference melody. Some
melodies preserved the SC identity whilst others did not. She found
transpositions to be perceived more similar than inversions and in
addition she discovered that the order of the notes and melodic
contour was a strong factor in perceived similarity.
</p>
<p>
Some authors have questioned the perceptual relevance of using TnI and
I equivalence as a basis for set classification. \citet{Deutsch1982}
seems unconvinced by evidence for the perceptual similarity of
inverted intervals. This can be illustrated by the example of major
and minor triads which, while perceptually distinct, are equivalent
under TnI and I equivalence.

<p>A number of studies have been done to ascertain the connection between
perceptual similarity ratings and the theoretical values obtained from
some PC-set similarity measures. A large number of relevant studies
are summarised by \citet{Kuusi2001} and the most significant ones are
mentioned here.
</p>
<p>
\citet{Bruner1984} used multidimensional scaling on subjects'
similarity ratings between trichords and tetrachords and on the
similarity values obtained from SIM. She compared the
2-dimensional solutions and found there to be little correlation.
</p>
<p>
\citet{Gibson1986} investigated non-traditional chords. He compared
subjects' ratings with similarity assessments calculated from Forte's
R-relations and Lord's similarity function. He also concluded there
was little correspondence between the two.
</p>
<p>
\citet{Stammers1994} compared subjects' ratings of 4 note melodies with
the theoretical values obtained from SIM. She found the ratings of
subjects with more musical training to be more correlated with the SIM
values.
</p>
<p>
\citet{Lane1997} compared subjects' ratings of pitch sequences with
corresponding values of seven ICV-based similarity measures: ASIM,
MEMB2, REL2, s.i., IcVSIM and AMEMB2 and concluded there to be a
strong relation.
</p>
<p>
\citet{Kuusi2001} compared subjects' ratings of pentachords with the
values obtained from 9 similarity measures. He found there to be a
connection between aurally estimated ratings and the theoretical
values and concluded that the abstract properties of set-classes do
have some perceptual relevance. He also comments on the way in which
this kind of study is conducted, suggesting that the way in which
subjects are presented with the stimuli has a significant effect on
the outcome.

<h3 id="sec-4-6"><span class="section-number-3">4.6</span> PC-set Theory for Analysis</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-6">

<p>PC-set theory as means for descriptive modelling of tonality is not
widely known outside of highly theoretical circles and the use of
set-class similarity measures seems mainly restricted to the theorists
who proposed them (for example, \citealt{Isaacson1996}). The basic
premise is simple: a musical piece is segmented and each segment
described by its SC. Similarity measures can be used to assess the
similarity between segments or between a segment and some reference
SC.
</p>
<p>
\citet{Huovinen2007} used a pentachordal tail segmentation policy
(each successive note defines a segment that includes the preceding
four notes) and compared these segments to comparison sets 7-1
(chromaticism) and 7-35 (diatonicism) using the REL distance
(<a href="#sec-14-7-1">REL</a>). They claim that the visual results of their analysis "reflect
pertinent aspects of our listening experience"
\citep[pp. 204]{Huovinen}.
</p>
<p>
\citet[chap. 5.3]{Martorell2013} uses a more systematic approach to
segmentation using multiple time scales. He proposes the class-scape,
a two-dimensional visualisation of a piece of music with time on the
x-axis and segmentation time-scale on the y-axis. A single SC can be
represented by highlighting the segment or alternatively each segment
can be shaded according to its REL distance from a comparison SC. He
emphasises that the class-scape is an exploratory tool rather than an
automated analysis system.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the most crucial aspect of using SC descriptions for tonal
analysis is the way in which a piece of music is segmented. The issue
of segmentation will be discussed further in Chapter <a href="#sec-9">Segmentation</a>.

<p>So far, PC-set theory and the similarity measures have been discussed
with only the broadest reference to familiar musical or musicologial
concepts. In order to use these techniques for real music description
and analysis some effort should be made to link SC theoretical
concepts to musicological ones.
</p>
<p>
The table below shows a collection of familiar chord types, cadence
types and scale types with their corresponding Tn-type prime-form SC,
Forte Name and index number (the position in an ordered list of all
351 Tn-type SCs). The table is divided into five vertical segments:
three-note chords, four-note chords, five-note chords, cadences and
scales.
</p>
<p>
In PC-set theory it is only the chord type that is relevant seeing as
transpositionally related (Tn-type) SCs are considered equivelant. For
example all major chords are considered equivelant regardless of the
root.

<p>Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a numerical visualisation technique

<p>Non-Metric MDS was described by \citet{Shepard1962} and it assumes
that the distance matrix values are related to points in an abstract
N-dimensional Euclidean space. An important consideration is that of
the dimensionality of the solution. For comprehension and
visualisation it is important to minimise the number of dimensions
however, there is a trade-off between the number of dimensions and the
accuracy of the model. For a given dimensionality, we obtain two
values: Stress and r<sup>2</sup>.

By plotting stress against r<sup>2</sup> for a number of dimensionalities is

distances between the original set). This kind of problem cannot be
observed through inspection of the values alone. The second issue is
that two different measures that are both self-consistent may produce
very different geometries from the same group of SCs. The question
then is, what exactly do the measures measure?

<p>Judgements of similarity form the basis of many cognitive processes
including the perception of tonality. Similarity between two objects
is often conceived as being inversely related to distance between them
in geometric space. For example, some tonal objects (chords, for
example) are perceived as close to one another whereas others are
further apart. In addition, the number of dimensions of the geometric
space is in connection with the number of independent properties that
are relevant for similarity comparisons. \citet{Gardenfors1995}
suggests that humans are naturally predisposed to create spatial
cognitive representations of perceptual stimuli due to the geometric
nature of the world we have evolved to inhabit. Therefore spatial
modelling of tonality, as well as helping to visualise the complex
multidimensional relationships between tonal phenomena, has the

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-2">

<p>Throughout history theorists have proposed many spatial
representations of tonality from different domains. From the graphemic
domain, \citet{Weber} and \citet{Schoenberg} both proposed simple
2-dimensional charts to display the proximity between keys. For
representation of chords, \citet{Riemann} models major and minor
triads as regions in a 2-dimensional space whilst \citet{Tymoczko2011}
proposes a variety high dimensional, non-euclidean chord spaces that
reflect the theoretical principles of voice leading. From the acoustic
domain, \citet{Shepard1982} proposes a five-dimensional model to
represent interval relations between pitches. Some theorists have
attempted to incorporate relations between several levels of tonal
hierarchy into one configuration. The "spiral array" of
\citet{Chew2000a} is a three-dimensional mathematical model which
simultaneously captures the relations between pitches, chords and
keys. The "chordal-regional space" of \citet{Lerdahl2001a} models the
relations between chords within a certain key.

<p>The auditory domain has been addressed through cognitive psychology by
\citet{Krumhansl1990} who used the probe-tone methodology
\citep{Krumhansl1979} to establish major and minor key profiles
(12-dimensional vectors containing the perceptual stability ratings of
each of the 12 pitch classes within a major or minor context). These
profiles, know as Krumhansl-Kessler profiles (KK-profiles), show the
hierarchy of pitches in major and minor keys. Correlating each of the
24 major and minor profiles produced a matrix of pairwise distances
which was fed to a dimensional scaling algorithm. The resulting
geometrical solution was found to have a double circular property
(circle of fifths and relative-parallel relations) which can be
modelled as the surface a 3D torus. Many spatial models of tonality
have this double circular property whether it is implicit
\citep{Weber,Schoenberg} or stated explicitly \citep{Lerdahl2001a}.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-4">

<p>Most of these models are limited to description of music in the
major-minor paradigm and are not capable of generalising beyond the
"western common practice". PC-set theory, once again, provides a
possible means to generalise to any kind of pitch-based music. By
considering a collection of tonal objects described by SCs, a
geometric space can be constructed to model their relations based on
some theoretical principle. Some PC-set theorists have proposed
explicit geometric spaces to model relations between SCs. The
distances in these spaces are expressed by models of similarity based
on voice leading \citep{Cohn2003,Tymoczko2012} or ICVs and the Fourier
transform \citep{Quinn2006, Quinn2007}. However, these models are only
designed to represent SCs of one cardinality-class at a time and
cannot model the relations between arbitrary collections of pitches.
</p>
<p>
Alternative spatial models are provided by the implicit geometries of
the values produced by the SC similarity measures discussed in <a href="#PC-Set-Similarity">PC-Set Similarity</a>. As mentioned in <a href="#sec-5-3">MDS with Similarity Measures</a>, MDS can be
used on values produced by similarity measure to create a geometric
space. \citet{Kuusi2001} and \citet{Samplaski2005a} both applied MDS to
the values produced from a variety of similarity measures. Samplaski
used TnI-type SCs while Kuusi used Tn-type. They both found reasonably
low-dimensional solutions and attempted to interpret each of the
dimensions. Kuusi interpreted three dimensions as corresponding to
chromaticism, wholetoneness and pentatonicism. Samplaski made similar
observations but found some dimensions in the higher-dimensional
spaces difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, he concluded that values
from similarity measure tend to agree (with some exceptions) and that
they measure constructs relating to familiar scales (diatonic,
hexatonic, octatonic, etc.).

<p>Measures which fail to meet criteria C1, i.e. that cannot compare SCs
of different cardinalities, are clearly inadequate for systematic
analysis of music, which might require the comparison of any two
arbitrary segments regardless of how many PCs they contain. Both
s.i. (<a href="#sec-14-3-1">s.i.</a>) and sf (<a href="#sec-14-2-1">sf</a>) were proposed specifically for SCs of the same
cardinality and so will be excluded from further discussion. Some
other measures which were intended to compare SCs of different
cardinalities nonetheless have problems. Measures such as SIM (<a href="#sec-14-1-2">SIM</a>)
and K (<a href="#sec-14-1-1">K</a>) give unintuitive values when the cardinalities of the SCs
being compared differ greatly and, in addition, the range of values
produced depends on the cardinality of the sets (failure to meet
criteria C3.1). Measures of this type will also be excluded.

<p>An important consideration when using similarity measures is the type
of SC being compared. Many of the measures are designed for comparison
of TnI-type SCs, however, owing to issues riased in <a href="#sec-4-5">Perceptual Relevance</a> regarding the perceptual relevance of invertionally related
sets, here, measures will be selected for use with Tn-type SCs. This
means that the measure should be able to discriminate between
inversionally related sets. All the single-nC measures which
exclusively consider interval content (ICVs) in the comparison
procedure can therefore be discounted, as inversionally related sets
have identical ICVs.

<p>Although many theorists have supposed that interval-class subsets are
of paramount importance in similarity judgments, no thorough
investigation has been carried out as to the exact perceptual
significance of subset cardinality. Single-nC measures presuppose that
subsets of one particular cardinality contribute to similarity above
all others. In the interest of systematicity, we will not make this
assumption instead assuming that subsets of all cardinalities are
equally relevant and should be considered. Similarity measures that
exhaustively consider all subset cardinalities meet criteria C5 and
are total measures (see <a href="#sec-4-4-2">Similarity Measures</a>). The six total measures

<p>In previous chapters we have examined the fundamental aspects of tonal

capable of capturing the three important elements of tonality as
context. Through a desire for both perceptual relevance and
systematicity a subset of these techniques has been identified as most
pertinent, specifically Tn-type SCs and total similarity measures.

In this chapter the six total similarity measures will be examined
more closely and placed in practical context through examination of
the values they produce. Section <a href="#Trivial-Froms">Trivial Froms</a> describes the concept

<p>Three of the 351 Tn-type SCs are known as trivial forms: 1-1, 11-1 and
12-1. Due to their lack of musical or harmonic significance, these SCs
are usually excluded from the work of SC-theorists. However, it is
important that they be included in any systematic description and that
their similarity to other sets be given a meaningful value. The next
chapter will discuss each of the total measures and specify how each
of the trivial forms is to be dealt with if it was not made explicit
by the theorist. 
</p>
<p>
The total measures which will be discussed make comparisons based on
the subset content of a set. SC 1-1, which has no subsets, is rarely
accounted for in such measures and in these cases a simple method will
be used: Comparisons involving X = 1-1 and Y will be given the value
\(1\#Y\). Thus, the value will be the ratios of the cardinalities with 1
indicating maximum similarity.

difference between corresponding values can be calculated and plotted
on similar grids. This gives an overall visualisation of where the
measures most disagree. Figure <a href="#fig-absdiff">absdiff</a> shows a matrix of
plots each comparing the values of two measures. Each plot displays
only half the table as the they are symmetric. The lighter blue and

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">

<p>As mentioned in <a href="#sec-4-6">PC-set Theory for Analysis</a>, segmentation is a very
important stage of the analysis. The segmentation policy used strongly
influences the SC content that can be observed, with larger segments
tending to contain higher cardinality sets. Using a sliding window to
segment the music requires careful consideration of the specific
window length and hop size depending not only on the type and
cardinality of sets that the analyst desires to observe but also on
the way in which the data will then be visualised.
</p>
<p>
In this chapter we outline two segmentation policies:
</p><ol>
<li>A sliding window with fixed length and hop size.
</li>
<li>The systematic segmentation policy of \citet{Martorell2013}.
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="sec-9-1"><span class="section-number-3">9.1</span> Systematic Segmentation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-1">

<p>\citet[chap. 5.3]{Martorell2013} specifies a fully systematic
segmentation policy which exhaustively records every change in the PC
material of a piece. The segments are of variable length but together
capture the entire SC contents of the music. With each segment indexed
in time by its centre, the data structure, known as a cass-scape, is a
sparse 3-dimensional binary matrix with axes representing time,
time-scale (segment length) and set class.
</p>
<p>
\citet[chap. 5.3.5]{Martorell2013} specifies two compact
representations of this data as a means of observing the the global SC
content of a piece.
</p>
<p>
Class-matrix: The class-matrix is a 2d projection the class-scape
obtained by removing the time-scale information. This, in effect, acts
to expand each point to the actual duration of the segment it
represents.
</p>
<p>
Class-vector: The class-vector is a further reduction of data showing
the relative active duration of each class in the class-matrix and is
expressed as a percentage of the total duration of the piece.
</p>
<p>
The systematic segmentation policy was applied to a MIDI
representation of the C major Prelude from Book 1 of The Well Tempered
Clavier by Bach. Figures <a href="#fig-classmat">classmat</a> and <a href="#fig-classvec">classvec</a>
show the class-matrix and class-vector respectively for the Bach
prelude. This information gives a global indications as to the types
of sonorities contained within the piece.

<p>
From this complete information it is also possible to view statistical
information about which SCs or type of SCs appear in which time
scale. Figure <a href="#fig-avgseglengthsc">avgseglengthsc</a> plots the average segment
length and standard deviation for each SC. Figure

<h3 id="sec-9-2"><span class="section-number-3">9.2</span> Sliding Window</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-2">

<p>Segmentation using a sliding window with fixed window and hop size is
used to obtain an SC time series of one specific time-scale. This time
series is then used for the visualisation techniques outlined in the
next chapter. The purpose of the sliding window is to allow the
analyst to focus on particular sets or tune in to one particular
cardinality. This tuning process is performed through selection of an
appropriate window and hop size. The selection of window and hop size
can be informed by exploration of the data obtained from the
systematic segmentation.
</p>
<p>
For example, from Figure <a href="#fig-avgseglengthcard">avgseglengthcard</a> in the previous
section it can be seen that three note chords have an average window
length of between one and two beats. Specifically, from Figure
<a href="#fig-avgseglengthsc">avgseglengthsc</a>, major chords (3-11B) have an average window
length of closer to two beats. Figure <a href="#fig-cvplusswseg">cvplusswseg</a> displays
the results of a sliding window segmentation of the piece with a
window size of two beats and hop size of one beat. The SC contents
extracted from this segmentation are displayed in red on top of the
class-vector. This representation gives an indication of what
proportion of the overall class contents have been retrieved by the
sliding window segmentation.

<p>
The plot shows that the particular segmentation policy has captured a
higher proportion of SC 3-11B than other types. This specific
targeting of SCs will be exploited in the visualisation techniques
described in <a href="#sec-10">Visualisation</a>.

<h3 id="sec-10-1"><span class="section-number-3">10.1</span> Distance Plot</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-10-1">

<p>The distance plot provides a simple means of capturing how the pitch
content of a piece evolves in time with respect to a specific SC. It
involves segmenting the piece using a fixed sliding window and
calculating the distance between each segment and a comparison set.
</p>
<p>
There are three interdependent parameters which must be selected
according to the specific intentions of the analyst: Segmentation
(window and hop size), comparison set and similarity/distance
measure. The segmentation determines the captured SC content which
should be targeted according to its relationship to the comparison
set. This relationship is determined by the measure used which must
possess an adequate degree of discrimination so as to produce
noticeable changes in the time series.
</p>
<p>
Figure <a href="#fig-distplot">distplot</a> shows an example distance time series
plotted in as a line for the Bach Prelude. The same sliding window
segmentation as Figure <a href="#fig-cvplusswseg">cvplusswseg</a> was used so as to capture
three note chords, specifically major chords (3-11B). Each segment was
compared to SC 3-11B using the ATMEMB-prime distance.

<p><img src="../plots/distplot.png"  alt="../plots/distplot.png" /></p>
<p>ATMEMB-prime distance plot (3-11B)</p>
</div>

<p>
As Figure <a href="#fig-cvplusswseg">cvplusswseg</a> indicates a higher proportion of SC
3-11B present in the segments, it is unsurprising to see the line
frequently displaying a distance of 0 where the segment coincides with
the comparison set. A plot such as this gives an indication as to the
tonal progression of the piece, indicating where the sonority most
resembles that of a simple major triads. Higher parts of the curve
indicate a departure from these triads and possibly more complicated
or less familiar harmonic passages.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-10-2">

<p>The distance plots described in the previous section can give a basic
view of the tonal progression of a piece. In many cases they contain
recurring patterns where passages with similar SC content producing
similar curves. A further visualisation technique is
autocorrelation. By autocorrelating the distance plot it may be
possible to capture some structural elements of the piece. The
autocorrelation time series will contain peaks corresponding to
"similar" passages. For example, an piece with a structure of A-B-A
will have an autocorrelation plot with a slight peak corresponding to
beginning of the repeat of section A.
</p>
<p>
Figure <a href="#fig-autocorr">autocorr</a> shows the autocorrelation function of the
distance plot in Figure <a href="#fig-distplot">distplot</a>. The peaks that appear at
regular intervals correspond to an approximate tonal tonal pattern
that recurs throughout the piece.

<p>As an alternative to using a specific comparison set, the distance of
a segment to other segments in the piece could be observed. A
systematic way of doing this is computing the self-similarity matrix
which provides a simples means for discovery of repetitions in a time
series. The patterns present in a visualisation of a self-similarity
matrix can indicate similar passages and structural elements of a
piece.

Figure <a href="#fig-selfsimmat">selfsimmat</a> shows the self-similarity matrix computed

<li>The addition of peak selecting and structural marking in the

<li>A more thorough understanding of the SC contents of a piece would

   a typical progression of major and minor triads would bring this
   approach closer the requirements of MIR researchers in chord
   recognition.
</li>
<li>Implicit SC spaces from multi-dimensional scaling of similarity
   measure values. Such spaces could provide deeper understanding of
   tonal progressions by analogy to trajectories in space. Partial SC
   spaces that include only a subset of all SCs could replicate some

   constructed for a piece through targeting of the relevant SC

<p>Castren specifies a different type of DV, which we shall call cDV to
distinguish it from the regular DV. It consistes of two rows,
\(cDV_{x}(X,Y)=X-Y\) and \(cDV_{y}(X,Y)=Y-X\). Any negative values in
either of the rows are set to zero.  In addition Castren defines the
weighted difference vector (wcDV) of two vectors X and Y as:
$$wcDV=\frac{cDV(X,Y)}{\#cDV(X,Y)}\times 100$$
