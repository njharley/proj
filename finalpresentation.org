* Agustin Comments
- main differences between pc-set and other tonal descriptions, in the
  sense of the "benefits" with respect to other ways of describing
  tonality.

- The same about the similarity measures. Something (very general) has
  to be said in this respect from the very beginning, so as to
  motivate best the approach and catch the audience attention.

- Said differently, which are the limitations/shortcomings of other
  standard tonal descriptions and measures, that call for a different
  approach?

- problem to be approached rather than "a way of doing things", as
  well as a clear statement of your approach (in relation to other
  commonly used tonal descriptions)

- SC similarity measures:
  - why there are that many models (what they measure or attempt
    to measure).

- As for the term "similarity", I can't figure out what
  do you plan to explain (qualitative, perceptual, purely theoretical,
  analysis-related, ...). I think the similarity issue will trigger
  questions from the committee, as it is a hot topic in MIR.

- Maybe more than emphasizing the term "visualisation", I would use
  "representation". It is not actually necessary to "visualise" the
  resulting time series, for them to be informative. Some of them are
  actually used as input to other algorithms (e.g. SSM), and can be
  mined automatically without human intervention.

- Segmentation: I'm curious about what you plan to say about the
  segment length statistics. It is just a preliminar exploration or
  did you find some insights? I think some interesting stuff could be
  derived from this analysis.

- Visualisation: to me, the point here is to observe the tonal change
  in time "with respect to specific sets" (stress here), so I would
  maybe give stress to the "sets of interest" (and why they may be of
  interest). Which time-evolving musical (relevant) aspects are (or
  could be) evidenced?

- I like the visual sparsity of your slides (I would be even more
  sparse). In general, it is desirable to explain every concept
  directly with easy-to-understand examples, when possible, and to
  minimize the text and number of concepts in a single slide.

- Contributions of your work: 
  - Your SOA is not only comprehensive, but it is also a

  - deep and distilled review of the similarity measures
    - (sparse, not easy to find, not always properly documented,
      mostly used in non-analytical contexts, ...).
    - The organization of this information constitutes a nice
      contribution in itself.
    - Implementation of the measures in an easy-to-use way, which was
      something unavailable so far.
    - This brings tools, which were used only for
      specialists/theorists, closer to a broad community and to a
      range of potential applications.

  - The quantitative comparison between them for common sets (chords,
    scales). Did you conclude some general/clear discriminatory power
    among the measures, that it is worth mentioning?

- The application context: structure / pattern recognition. You should
  also state at the end

- what has not been done yet, in the context of the thesis. Are your
  results just exploratory/preliminary? Do the results point to some
  specific analysis target, to be addressed during the summer?

- Some questions that may arise from the thesis' committee:
  - How are your results comparable to existing analyses of Bach's WTC?
    (In any case, it is desirable to overlap some manual annotation
    showing the relevance/limitations of your plots, so as to be
    self-informative).
  - Is your approach saying something new/better about the piece, or is
    it just confirming what other approaches already do? If they just
    confirm existing knowledge, what is the (not yet exploited)
    potential? (e.g. using different comparison sets may reveal
    different musical aspects, which ones, ...).
  - Are the measures "better" than, let's say, Euclidian or correlation
    distances? In which respect?
  - The term "evaluation" in your title is maybe the strongest word,
    which may probably trigger questions from the committee. Do you plan
    to evaluate this with respect to some baseline/ground-truth?
    (e.g. structure segmentation tasks in MIREX). In general, I would
    try to reinforce and clarify "what" has been (or will be) evaluated,
    throughout your presentation.


* Presentation Script
** Title slide
- name, title, supervisor
** outline
- introduction
- methodology
- representation
- conclusions
- future work
** Introduxtion - Definitions
- first i want to do a quick clarification of the some of terms in the
  title as a preface the problem and objectives.
- firstly, tonal analysis:
  - used to here as a general term for any computational activities
    involving tonality. MIR etc
  - and it encompasses 2 stages
    - description: describing the tonal content.
    - representation: represent the content in a meaningful way.
- the other terms...
- set class theoy: a tool for description stage
- similarity measures: a tool fot the representation stage
- all these things will be gone into further later on
** Problem
- the problem has 2 parts
- firstly: existing approaches to tonal analysis lack depth
  - for example: the predominant use of template plate matching for
    chord and key recognition limit many systems to discrete
    boundaries.
  - when in fact fact tonality is a very fluid concept.
  - these approaches are ofter limited to the major-minor paradigm.
  - which is often an insufficient explanation of tonality even for
    some western music.
- the second part of the problem is use of non musical similarity
  measures
  - such as correlation or euclidean distance
  - using these purely mathematical measures seems counterintuituive
    in some cases as they most likely lack musical or perceptual
    relevance
** Objectives
- so, with those problems in mind, my objectives are as follows:
  1. To adopt a systematic approach to description of tonality.
  2. Use set class theoy
     - but not just to use it. i also want to 
     - justify its use as a systematic descriptive tool, capable of
       relating useful musical information as well as having a degree
       of perceptual relevance.
     - To position set class analysis among existing methods of tonal
       description such as chroma vector time-series.
  3. To create a comprehensive and practical survey of set class
     similarity measures.
     - To examine the measures in terms of systematicity and
       perceptual relevance.
  4. To develop techniques for the representation of set class
     description so as to expose useful musical information.
     - To utilise set class similarity in these representation.
  5. To demonstrate the utility of these techniques through specific
     analysis examples.
** Systematic Description
- here address objective 1: explain the fundamental basis of my
  apporach.
- so what does it mean to be systematic?
- the objective here is to not limit the description by basing it on
  high level concepts such as chord and key.
- but rather base it on mid-level concepts such as notes.
- by systematically detailing the position of every note you produce a
  description that is independent of high level concepts but none the
  less capable of capturing them.
- this kind of description is sometimes referred to as the musical
  surface.
- So that is the fundamental aim here in terms of description. its
  being sytematic.
** Set Class Theory - What?
- so now set class theory
- as i said before, it is a descriptive tool
- and before i go on to address onjective 2 i will briefly explain the
  basic principles for those who might be unfamiliar.
- the basic idea is pitches as numbers
- and the use of equivelance relations to reduce the amound of data
  required to describe.
- so first this is a pitch set with four members corresponding to an A
  mjor chord.
- the concept of set means that we dont care about the order of the
  members or whether the occur simulaneously or in sequence. and we
  inore repetitions.
- underneath there are the correpondning midi note numbers.
- so a pitch class is the residue class modulo 12 of the pitch numbers
  which are as follows.
- and of course as we ignore repetitions in a set the pitch class set
  is as follows.
- then you have a set class which is a way of grouping pitch class
  sets.
- for example all pitch class sets that are transpostions of each
  other belong to the same set class.
- the prime form of a set class is merely a convention for referring
  to the class by arranging the entries so that they start on 0 and
  are most tightly packed to the left.
- in addition theres another convention for ordering and naming the
  set classes called forte name after the guy who devised it. like so.
- this just means this is the 11th set class of cardinality 3 or
  size 3.
- so those are the basics...
** Set Class Theory - Why?
- now ill try and address objective 2. why use set class theory.
- well, it fits the mid-level critera i spoke of earlier as any
  collection of pitches can be described by its set class regardless
  of whether they have a specific harmonic role.
- it coalesces fairly tightly with perception.
  - by this i mean the fundamental principles i.e.:
    - octave equivelance
    - division of the octave into equivelance classes
    - and transpositional equivelance
  - have been shown to have a solid basis in perception.
- so interms of benefits and differences,
- well, as ive mentioned it constitues a substantial reduction of
  information but whilst presuming to still be systematic and
  perceptually relevant.
- the crucial difference between this type of description and other
  based on say chroma is that the relationships are all relative.
- by which i mean it is not capable of capturing the absolute note or
  chord labels. only the type.
- so thats set class theory...
** Similarity Measures - What?
- now: set class similarity measures:
- first, what are they?
  - well since the development of set class theory, many theorists
    have developed theoretical models that attempt to quantify which
    how similarity or distance detween two set classes.
  - there are countless different models that start from a wide range
    of theoretical or musical principles.
- so how exactly do they work?
  - well in this project i have limited by examination to a specific
    type of measure
  - which compare the subsets of set classes.
  - so a subset is smaller set class which can be embedded in a larger
    on.
  - and for a given set you can count all the instances of a smaller
    set classes which can be embedded in it and represent that
    information as a vector.
  - so these measures generally consist of a technique for comparing
    these subset vecotrs.
- so why use these measures?
  - well this goes back to the second part of the problem.
  - these measure are musically relevant
  - and potentially perceptually relevant.
  - although the perceptual relevance of these measures has only been
    investigated somehwta sporadically and inconclusively
  - they have none the less be formed with musical intuition in mind.
** Similarity Measures - Survey
- so this brings us to objective 3:
- a survey of the measures which as i mentioned are numerous.
- so i surveyed 25+ different measures.
- then categorised them in terms of two things.
  - firstly, how systematic their approach. in terms of what ive
    already explained.
  - and secondly, their perceptual relevance.
- the outcome of this survey was the selection of 6 differnt measures
  from 4 theorists.
- these are their cryptic names
- they all have a different fundamental approach.
** Similarity Measures - survey 2
- the second party of the survey was to examine the specific
  capabilities of each.
- by this i mean the descriminatory power.
- so here it useful to visualise some of the values.
- this plot shows:
  - the values produced for comparisons involving common tonal objects
    such as chords and scales.
  - the x and y axis show the set class corresponding to
  - and each square is coloured accoridng to the distance between
    them.
- from visualisations like this it was possible to draw some basic
  conclusions about the differences between the measures.
- but these difference i will discuss later in the context of
  representation.
** Segmentation
- so now the final part of my methodology is segmentation
- which is a really crucial stage.
- because the scale of observation has a huge effect on what can be
  observed.
- so my approach uses two segementation policies that work in
  conjunction.
  - first a fully systematic method
    - which contains the entire SC contents of piece
  - second a sliding window
    - with fixed window and hop size
    - and this is for tuning into certain sets of interest
  - ill talk about what i mean by sets of interest a bit later.
  - the reason for the two methods is that selecting the size of the
    sliding window can be based on information from the systematic
    segmentation.
** Systematic Segmentation
- so to explain the function of the each of the segmentation methods
  ill use an example.
- its this piece which some people may know.
- and so the we apply the systematic segmentation method to this
- and it exhaustively finds every change in pitch material
- segmenting the piece in every possible way.
- the resulting data structure can be thought of a 3-dimensional
  binary matrix.
- with axes representing time, time-scale (segment length) and set
  class.
** Class Matrix and vector
- an intermediate representation can be used to view some global
  information about the sc contents of the piece.
- this is called class vector.
  - it shows the total time that each set class is present as a
    proportion of the total length.
  - this gives quite a compact picture of the overall set class
    contents of the piece.
  - these three largest bars correspond to
    - major triads
    - the authentic cadence
    - and the diatonic set
  - so that tells you something about the general sonority of the
    music.
** Sliding Window
- now, the sliding window is used tune in or focus on the specific set
  classes that youre interested in.
- obviously you have to select the right window and hopsize and these
  will depend on the sets you want to observe.
- so its possible to use data from the systematic segmentation to
  inform choices about the sliding window parameters.
** Sliding window card avg
- this plot shows:
- for each cardinality the average length of the segments in which
  they appear.
- and the standard deviation.
- so if we wanted to capture 3 and 4 note chords for example we can
  see that they appear in segments of mainly between 1 and 2 beats.
** Sliding window sc avg
- alternatively we can view the same information but for each separate
  setclass.
- for example we want to capture major triads which we can see appear
  mainly in segment of around 2 beats.
** Sliding window class vec + slding content
- so if we apply a sliding window with window size 2 beats and hop
  size 1 beat...
- we can view the contents of the sliding window description in
  relation to the class vector which i explained earlier.
- as you can see we've managed to capture a large number of major
  triads
- as well as...
** Representation
- so those are the two segmentation methods, and how they can be used
  together.
- now i will explain 3 techniques that utilise sc similarity measures
  to represent the sc data from these descriptions.
  - they are distance plot
  - autocorrelation
  - and self similarity matrix
** Distance Plot
- so, distance plot:
- the basic idea of the distance plot is to represent tonal change
  in time with respect to a comparison set.
- There are three interdependent parameters which must be selected
  according to your spcific intentions:
  - Segmentation (window and hop size),
  - comparison set
  - and similarity/distance measure.
- The segmentation determines the captured SC content which should be
  targeted according to its relationship to the comparison set. This
  relationship is determined by the measure used which must possess an
  adequate degree of discrimination so as to produce noticeable
  changes in the time series.
- so here we have the distance plot calculated using the sliding
  window segmentation described before,
- a comparison set 3-11B the major triad
- and the atmemb distance.
- as we know that this window captures a high proportion of major
  triads from the previous section,
- it is unsurprising to see the distance plot dropping to zero where
  the segment coincides with the comparison set.
- the points where it rises higher correspond to departures from
  familiar major chords.
- actually we can already see a kind of pattern:
  - the major triad seems to appear at fairly regular intervals.
- this is where the next representation technique come in...
** Autocorrelation
- most people are familiar with autocorrelation im sure.
- so, this is the autocorrelation of the distance plot we just saw.
- as you can see there are peaks at regular intervals two bar
  intervals.
- the highest being at four bars.
- this would seem to indicate that some aspect of the music is
  repeating at regular 2 intervals.
- and that probably makes sense. most music is strucutered somehow in
  even groups like this.
** Self-Similarity Matrix
- finally, the self-similarity matrix,
- which again im sure most people are familiar with.
- this despenses with the comparison set
- and instead compares each segment to every other segment.
- this is a good way of finding repetitions in any time-series.
- so this is the ssm for the sliding window that we've been using.
- theres the familair diagonal down the middle.
- but the there are a few other features visible.
- most notable is the diagonal ive highlighted. 
- and this corresponds to the repetition of bars 7-11 in bars 15-19
  but with a transposition.
- so those are the three techniques.
** Analysis Tool
- finally
- Due to the complex relationship between the different parameters
  involved in this kind of analysis, it is desirable to work in an
  interactive and exploratory environment.
- The analysis tool combines all of the presented representation
  techniques in a single Matlab GUI.
- This kind of tool provides a test bench for exploring the
  capabilities of these techniques and an environment for conducting
  preliminary experiments.
- this is screen shot shows is of the example that i have just
  explained.
** Conclusions
- approach:
- that is, objectives 1 and 2,
- this work has demonstrated the capability of systematic set class
  descritpions to convey useful musical information.
- analysis outcomes: so objectives 4 and 5.
- the experiments ive done have constituted a preliminary examination
  of the complex relationship between the various parameters.
- they have also revealed that the

* Presentation Script again
** Outline
- this is the outline of my presentation
- first and introduction:
  - where i outline the problem and objectives
- then my methodology in which i address each of the objectives
- and finally conclusions and future work
** Introduction
*** Problem
1. existing approaches to tonal analysis lack depth.
   - the predominant use of template matching for chord and key
     estimation gives systems a narrow view of tonality and restricts
     them in many cases to the major-minor paradigm, which is arguably
     insufficient for even some western music.
2. the use of non-musical similarity measures
   - such as correlation and euclidean distance.
   - the use of these purely mathematical measures seems inappropriate
     when considering musical objects.
*** Definitions
- now i want to just give a quick clarification of some terms from the
  title as a preface to the objectives.
  - tonal analysis
  - Set class theory
  - similarity measures
*** Objectives
1. adopt a systematic approach to description
2. use set class theory
   - justify
   - position
3. survey similarity measures
4. develop techniques for the representation of set class data
   utilising these similarity measures.
5. demonstrate the capabilities of the method through specific
   analysis examples.
** Methodology
*** Systematic description
- this addresses objective 1
- and explains the fundamental basis to my approach.
- what does it mean to be systematic.
- the key here, is not base the description on high level concepts
  such as chord and key, which is restrictive.
- instead base it on mid-level concepts such as notes.
- systematic mid-level descriptions based on notes can be
  fundamentally independent of high level concepts but at the same
  time capable of capturing them.
- so the two importent terms here are systematic and midlevel.
*** Set class theory - what?
- as i said before its a tool for description
- before justifying it i will first explain the basic principles for
  those who are unfamiliar.
- pitch set 4 members corresponding to an a major chord.
- below is the corresponding pitch class set
- with the octave information removed
- 
- pitch class: residue class modulo 12 of the pitchs
- ignore repeated 9
- set class groups pitch class sets which are transpositions of each
  other.
- prime form is a convention for notating set class. with entries
  packed most tightly left and starting on zero.
- forte name is another convention for ordering and naming scs.
- 3-11B just means the 11th set of size 3. the B is not important for
  this explanation.
*** Set class theory - why?
- so that was the what now the why
- it fulfills the mid-level critera i specified earlier
  - in that any collection of pitchs can be represented by a set class
    regardless of any specific harmonic role.
  - so its systematic in that respect.
- it has a degree of perceptual relevance
  - octave equivelance and transpositional equivelance both have a
    solid basis in perception.
- the benefits:
  - it provides a substantial reduction in information whilst
    remaining systematic and perceptually relevant.
- differences:
  - all the relations ships are relative
  - meaning it does not capture absolute note and chord labels only
    types.
*** Set Class Similarity Measures - What and Why
- what are they?
  - models that attempt to quantify the similarity ordistance between
    2 set classes.
  - there are countless different models starting from a wide range of
    fundamental principles.
- for the most part they work by comparing the subsets of two set classes.
- why?
  - this goes back to the second part of the problem.
  - these measures are musical
  - although the perceptual relevance has only be examined
    sporadically and inconclusively...
  - these measures were designed to reflect musical intuitions.
*** Set Class Similarity Measures - Survey
- objective 3 - the survey
- i surveys 25+ measures
- categorised them according to
  - how systematic their approach
  - and how perceptually relevant
- the outcome was to select 6 measure from 4 theorists.
- and examine the values they produced for common tonal objects such
  as chords and scales.
- the preliminary conclusions were that different measures have
  different capabilities and discriminatory power.
- each might potentially be useful in a certain context.
*** Segmentation
- so now the final part of the methodology: segmentation.
- this is a crucial stage as the scale of observation greatly affects
  the tonality of a piece.
- so for this method i propose two segmentation methods to be used in
  conjustion.
  1. fisrt a fully systematic method (from the work of agustin)
     - this provides the complete sc contents of a piece
  2. second a sliding window
     - with fixed window and hope size
     - for tuneing in to sets on interest
     - i will explain... later
*** Segmentation - Fully systematic
- to demonstrate how the two methods work in conjunction i will use an
  example.
- its this piece which some people may know.
- so first we apply the systematic segmentation
- which exhaustively records every combination of adjacent notes
- so that every possible set class is recorded
*** Segmentation - Fully Systematic
- a useful intermediate representation of this data is the
  class-vector.
- which shows the activation time of each set class as a proportion of
  the total duration.
- from this its possible to see a global picture of the set class
  contents and deduce certain things about the sonority
- for example:
*** Segmentation - Sliding window
- so now the sliding window.
- we need to select a window and hop size
- this depends on the "sets of interest"
*** segmentation - sliding window
- so say for example we want to capture major triads in our sliding
  window
- we can use information from the systematic segmentation to inform
  our parameter selection.
- this plot shows, for each set class, the average segment length in
  which it occurs.
- so for major triads (3-11B) we can see they mainly occur in segments
  around 2 beats
*** Segmentation - sliding window
- so using this information
- we set the window size to 2 beats and hop size to 1 beat
- and we can view the contents of our sliding window in relation to
  the class vector from before.
- this is shown here with the class vector in blue and the sliding
  window contents in red.
- so you can see we capture a high proportion of major triads as well
  as some of these other set classes.
** Representaion
*** Representation
- so now we have segmented and tuned into our sets of interest.
- we need to represent the data.
- here i will describe the three representation techniques that use
  the set class similarity measures.
*** Distance plot
- first there is the distance plot
- the main idea of the distance plot is to represent the tonal change
  in time with respect to a comparison set
- there are three interdependent parameters here that need selecting:
  - window and hop size determine the captured sc contents
  - which should be targeted according to their relationship to the
    comparison set.
  - this relationship is determined by the measure used.
- here is the resulting distance plot from the sliding window applied
  earlier.
- with a comparison set of 3-11B major triad.
- the points where the curve goes to zero are where the segment and
  the comparison set coincide.
- the higher points of the curve indicate a departure from major
  triads to possible more complex or less familiar chords.
- as you can see there is some element of repetition to the curve.
*** Autocorrelation
- and thats where the next representation comes in.
- autocorrelation: which im sure everyone is familiar with.
- this is the auto correlation of the distance plot you just saw.
- as you can see there are peaks occuring at regular intervals
- indicating that some tonal aspect of the music is repeating
  regularly at 2 and 4 bar intervals.
*** SSM
- the final technique is SSM
- which again im sure everyone is familiar with.
- this despenses with the comparison set and instead compares each
  segment to every other.
- this is a good way of finding repetitions in a time series.
- so here is the SSM of previous example.
- you can the familiar diagonal down the middle
- and there are a few other features specifically this diagonal which
  ive highlighted
- and it corresponds to this passage from bars 7-11 which is repeated
  in bars 15 to 19 with a transposition.
*** Analysis Tool
- so those are the three representation techniques.
- the complex relation ship between the parameters makes it desireable
  to work in an interactive and exploratory environment.
- so i develiped this tool which combines all the techniques into a
  single matlab gui.
- so this can act as a kind of test bench and an environment for
  conducting preliminary experiments.
- this is a screen shot displaing the example that i just described.
** Conclusions
- so in terms of the approach:
  - i think that this work demonstrates that set class descriptions
    and representations involving sc similarity measures. are capable
    of relating useful musicological information
  - and that they are a starting point for addressing the this
    research problem.
  - in particular they seem adept in capturing musical structure and
    significant boundaries.
- in terms of the analysis conclusions:
  - the work i have done constitutes preliminary experiments which
    explore the relation ship between the various parameters.
  - and i have some very basic conclusions relating to this in terms
    of what are the sets of interest and why and what measure to use
    etc.
- as for the contribution of this work
  - i think the survey of similarity measures constitues a substantial
    contribution as this information is
    - sparse, not easy to find, not always properly documented
    - so the organisation of this information and the implementation
      of the measures brings helps bring these potentially useful
      tools into the mainstream of music research.
  - secondly the analysis tool:
    - will be invaluable to anyone wishing to explore these techniques
      further.
** Further Work
- so future work
  - well in the near future, and by this i mean potentiall over the
    summer:
    - I intendt to obtain a better understanding of the relationship
      between the parameters.
      - better understanding the set class contents of a piece and
        what different sets signify.
      - what are the sets of interest and why?
      - which measure to use in which context.
      - and this could be achieved through simpler analysis examples.
      - althought the bach prelude.
  - so where is this all leading in the farther future
    - with sufficiant conprehension of how to select parameters
    - an eventual goal of would be using set class information of this
      type as feature vector with which to perform other MIR or music
      research tasks.
    - there are two aspces to this: baring in mind this work occupies
      a mid level perspective. it is neccessary to
      - approach the this mid level description from low level
        descriptions such as those from audio signals
      - approaching high level musicological understanding from the
        mid-level.
