** Introduction
*** Definitions
BRIEFLY EXPLAIN THE TITLE AS A ANTECEDENT TO THE PROBLEMS AND
OBJECTIVES.
- Tonal Analysis: what?
  - used as a very general term
  - 2 stages
    1. description/modelling
       - tools
    2. representation
       - represent the data
       - retrieve/augment traditional musicology
       - This will be explained more later.
- Set class theory
  - tool for the description stage
- Similarity measures
  - tool for the representation stage
*** Problem
EXPLAIN THE TWO MAIN ASPECTS OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM
1. Existing descriptions of tonality lack depth
   - chord and key
   - template matching
   - major-minor paradigm
2. Use of non-musical similarity measures
   - euclidean distance
   - correlation
   - counter-intuitive
   - not musically or perceptually relevant
SEMANTIC GAP
*** Objectives
1. SYSTEMATIC description of tonality
   - To adopt a SYSTEMATIC approach to description of tonality.
2. Use Set class theory
   - To justify set class analysis as a systematic descriptive tool
     capable of relating useful musical information as well as having
     a degree of perceptual relevance.
   - To position set class analysis among existing methods of tonal
     description such as chroma vector time-series.
3. Survey set class similarity measures
   - comprehensive and practical
   - To examine the measures in terms of systematicity and perceptual
     relevance.
4. To develop techniques for the representation of set class
   information
   - appropriate representations of the data from set class
     descriptions so as to expose meaningful musical information.
5. To utilise set class similarity in these representations.
6. To evaluate the analytical potential of this approach
   - The analytical potential of the model will be evidenced through
     specific analysis examples.
   - these examples will constitue preliminary experiments and
     exploration of the techniques. a proof of concept.
** Systematic Description
OBJECTIVE 1: WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE SYSTEMATIC.
- mid-level approach
- musical surface of notes
** Set Class Theory
THE TOOL USED FOR SYSTEMATIC DESCRIPTION
*** Basics
DESCRIBE THE BASIC PRINCIPLES IN SET CLASS THEORY.
- Pitch class
- PC-set
- Set Class
*** Justify and position
OBJECTIVES 2

- capable of describing the musical surface
- perceptual relevance
- how is it different to existing approaches?
- benefits?
** Similarity Measures
TOOL FOR REPRESENTATION
*** Introduction
- What?
  - theoretical models of similarity
  - many different models and approaches
  - why are there so many models.
  - what do they measure
- Why?
  - EXPLAIN WHY SIMILARITY MEASURES ARE IMPORTANT IN GENERAL.
  - visualisation
*** Survey
OBJECTIVE 3
- surveyed how
- outcomes
*** Total Measures
- Subset vector based
- consider subsets of all sizes
- 6 total measures
- example plot of chord comparisons
- general conclusions
- this will be used later
** Set Class Analysis
- basic steps
  - Desrcibe/model
    - segment
    - describe each segment with its SC
  - representation
    - find a appropriate representation of the data
    - visualise
- not much previous work has been done
  - class scapes
- segmentations is a crucial 
** Segmentation
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STAGE
- why is it important (timing/scale of oberservation)
  - the segment size determines the size of the sets
- two segmentation policies to be used in conjunction
  1. fully systematic segmentation
     - retrieve the entire sc contents of a piece
  2. sliding window
     - for represntation stage
     - tune in to sets of interest
*** Systematic
- how?
- class-scape
- class matrix
- class vector
- Example class matrix and class vector for bach prelude
- what do they show?
*** Sliding Window
- window and hop size selection
- what are the sets of interest?
- window and hop size can be informed by the previous plots
- Example: Average seg size for SCs and card
- choose 3 and 4 note chords
- Example: class vector with superimposed sliding window contents
** Representation
*** Distance Plot
- what?
  - represents tonal change in time "with respect to specific sets"
- how?
  - segmentation (window and hop size selection)
  - comparison set selection
  - what are the sets of interest and why?
- peaks
- recurring patterns in the curve
*** autocorrelation
- autocorrelate distance plot
- peaks
- reveals structure
- example plot
*** Self-similarity matrix
- no comparison set
- systematically compare all segments
- reveals structure
- example plot
** Analysis Tool
- many parameters
- exploratory tool
- demonstration
  - cadential sets
  - diatonic set
  - chromatic sets
  - 8-23
  - different measures
** Conclusions
- systematic mid-level descriptions are a starting point for many
  applications
- pc set theory
- similarity measures
- visualisation techniques
- analysis tool
** Future work

* Agustin Comments
- main differences between pc-set and other tonal descriptions, in the
  sense of the "benefits" with respect to other ways of describing
  tonality.

- The same about the similarity measures. Something (very general) has
  to be said in this respect from the very beginning, so as to
  motivate best the approach and catch the audience attention.

- Said differently, which are the limitations/shortcomings of other
  standard tonal descriptions and measures, that call for a different
  approach?

- problem to be approached rather than "a way of doing things", as
  well as a clear statement of your approach (in relation to other
  commonly used tonal descriptions)

- SC similarity measures:
  - why there are that many models (what they measure or attempt
    to measure).

- As for the term "similarity", I can't figure out what
  do you plan to explain (qualitative, perceptual, purely theoretical,
  analysis-related, ...). I think the similarity issue will trigger
  questions from the committee, as it is a hot topic in MIR.

- Maybe more than emphasizing the term "visualisation", I would use
  "representation". It is not actually necessary to "visualise" the
  resulting time series, for them to be informative. Some of them are
  actually used as input to other algorithms (e.g. SSM), and can be
  mined automatically without human intervention.

- Segmentation: I'm curious about what you plan to say about the
  segment length statistics. It is just a preliminar exploration or
  did you find some insights? I think some interesting stuff could be
  derived from this analysis.

- Visualisation: to me, the point here is to observe the tonal change
  in time "with respect to specific sets" (stress here), so I would
  maybe give stress to the "sets of interest" (and why they may be of
  interest). Which time-evolving musical (relevant) aspects are (or
  could be) evidenced?

- I like the visual sparsity of your slides (I would be even more
  sparse). In general, it is desirable to explain every concept
  directly with easy-to-understand examples, when possible, and to
  minimize the text and number of concepts in a single slide.

- Contributions of your work: 
  - Your SOA is not only comprehensive, but it is also a

  - deep and distilled review of the similarity measures
    - (sparse, not easy to find, not always properly documented,
      mostly used in non-analytical contexts, ...).
    - The organization of this information constitutes a nice
      contribution in itself.
    - Implementation of the measures in an easy-to-use way, which was
      something unavailable so far.
    - This brings tools, which were used only for
      specialists/theorists, closer to a broad community and to a
      range of potential applications.

  - The quantitative comparison between them for common sets (chords,
    scales). Did you conclude some general/clear discriminatory power
    among the measures, that it is worth mentioning?

- The application context: structure / pattern recognition. You should
  also state at the end

- what has not been done yet, in the context of the thesis. Are your
  results just exploratory/preliminary? Do the results point to some
  specific analysis target, to be addressed during the summer?

- Some questions that may arise from the thesis' committee:
  - How are your results comparable to existing analyses of Bach's WTC?
    (In any case, it is desirable to overlap some manual annotation
    showing the relevance/limitations of your plots, so as to be
    self-informative).
  - Is your approach saying something new/better about the piece, or is
    it just confirming what other approaches already do? If they just
    confirm existing knowledge, what is the (not yet exploited)
    potential? (e.g. using different comparison sets may reveal
    different musical aspects, which ones, ...).
  - Are the measures "better" than, let's say, Euclidian or correlation
    distances? In which respect?
  - The term "evaluation" in your title is maybe the strongest word,
    which may probably trigger questions from the committee. Do you plan
    to evaluate this with respect to some baseline/ground-truth?
    (e.g. structure segmentation tasks in MIREX). In general, I would
    try to reinforce and clarify "what" has been (or will be) evaluated,
    throughout your presentation.
