#+TITLE: Evaluation of SetPitch-Class Set Similarity Measures for Tonal Analysis 

* Pitch class set theory analysis
** Why
- Description of musical surface
- Call for systemacity
*A. Martorell PHD Thesis*
=Among the possible conceptual frameworks for describing tonal content, we will adopt the most systematic one, namely pitch-class set analysis, as it also provides a exible and widespread analytical lexicon.=
*Allan Forte - The structire of Atonal Music, 1973* 
creates a music theory analogous to mathematical set theory

** Pitch-set class
- *Pitch-class* (Babbit, 1955) is defined, for the TET system, as an
  integer representing the residue class modulo 12 of a pitch,
- Unordered pitch-class set is a set of pitch-classes without
  repetitions in which the order of succession of the elements in the
  set is not of interest.
- In the TET 12 system, there exist 4096 distinct pc-sets, so a
  vocabulary of 4096 symbols is required for describing any possible
  segment of music.
- Any pc-set can also be represented by its intervalic content
  (Hanson, 1960).
- Intervals considered regardless of their direction are referred to
  as interval classes.
- There exist 6 different interval classes, spanning from 1 to 6
  semitones.
- The total account of interval classes in a pc-set can be arranged as
  a 6-dimensional data structure coined as an interval vector (Forte,
  1964).

** Class Equivelance

- Two arbitrary pc-sets are considered equivalent if and only if they
  belong to the same class.
- Cardinality: referred to as the number of elements in the set
- Cardinality is the simplest equivalence (Rahn, 1980, p. 74).
- However, the radical differences among the possible sonorities
  within a given cardinality does not provide a proper equivalence
  domain in many practical cases.

*** iv Equiveance
- Interval vector equivalence (iv-equivalence) groups pc-sets sharing
  the same interval vector.
- It is thus possible to map any segment of music to one of the 197
  different iv-types.

*** Tn Equivelance
- Two pc-sets related to each other by transposition belong to the
  same set class, transpositional and they share a similar sonority in
  many musical contexts.
- For instance, this applies to all pentatonic segments of music, for
  which we say that they are Tn-equivalent or that they are of the
  same Tn-type. There exist 348 distinct Tn-types

*** TnI Equivelance
- The inversional/transpositional set-class (TnI-equivalence, or
  Tn/TnI-type) groups all the pc-sets that are related by
  transposition and/or inversion of their intervals (Forte, 1964).
- For instance, all major and minor triads are TnI-equivalent (any
  major triad can be transformed into any minor triad by inversion and
  transposition), although not Tn-equivalent (no major triad can be
  transformed into any minor triad by only transposition).
- The TnI-equivalence maps any pc-set to one of the 220 distinct TnI-types. 

*** Z-relation
Both iv and TnI-equivalence share most of their classes, with some
exceptions, named Z-relations (Forte, 1964) or isomeric relations
(Hanson, 1960), for which the same interval vector does not group
pitch-class sets under TnI-equivalence (Lewin, 1959).

* Similarity Measures
** What are measures?
** What do they measure
** Summary of existing measure
*** Tietelbaum, 1965
- Similarity index (s.i.)
- s.i.(X,Y) = square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between corresponding terms of the IcVs
- same cardinality
- while evaluable to some degree by MDS, is still not very attractive

*** Forte, 1973
- Rn
- same cardinality
- indicates degree of correspondence
- *is binary so cannot create distamce matrix*

*** REL Lewin, 1979
- any cardinality
- pcset

*** Morris, 1979-80
- SIM
- SIM(X,Y) = sum of the absolute values of the differences between corresponding IcV entries for the sets

*** Rahn, 1979-80
- MEMBn(J,X,Y)
- ATMEMB 
- ATEMB2
  - subset based measure (Samplaski)

*** Lewin, 1979-80
- REL2(X,Y)
- multiplies rather than adds corresponding IcV entries

*** Lord, 1981
- sf
- sf(X,Y) = half sum of absolute values of the differences between corresponding IcV| entries of the sets

*** Isaacson, 1990
*IcVSIM*
- addresses short comings of above methods
- any cardinality
1. provide distinc value for each pair of sets
2. be useful for sets of any size
3. provide a wide range of discrete values
*ISIM*
- inconsistent with itself

*** Scott & Issacson
- ANGLE

*** Castren
- uses subset content
- RECREL (Castren)

* MDS
*multidimentsional scaling*

- Shepard (1962)
- Kruskal (1964a, 1964b) 
- abstract N-dimensional euclidean space
- formula familia from cartesian geometry sqrt(x**2 + y**2 etc)

** MDS on Pcsets using distance function
- resulting geometries will tell us something about what properties of pcsets the functions are measuring
- if the geometries produced by different functions match up save for rotation, translation, or reflection, then,
  - either a) measuring the same constructs, whatever those might be
  - or b) measuring constructs that, while different, are themselves functions of some other underlying construct(s)

** CA

*cluster analysis*

There is a family of CA models, but they all work similarly: given a proximity or distance matrix, some method is used to pick the pair of objects most like each other, group them into a single cluster, and derive a new reduced matrix. When the process is finished, the objects will be grouped into a binary tree structure (exactly two branches descend from each node, and the objects are "leaves" at the termini of the final branches), where the distance between any pair of objects is related to the length of the path along the branches separating them.

** PMDS

*Probabalistic MDS*

- assumed there si euclidean space
- onjects are probability distributions
- variance
- PMDS is a technique still under development (2005)


* Temporal multi-scale set-class analysis
