* Introduction
- title
- about pc-set theory for decriptive modelling of tonality.

* Done
** Literature Review
1) overview of pc-set theory
   - aimed at wider community of music researchers
   - framed more practically than theoretically
   - standardised notation etc

2) survey of 25+ set class similarity measures and models
   - which all use different techniques and theoretical principles
   - and all the while trying to shed some light on the practical
     implications of the techniques.
** Measure selection
- then, interms of selecting which of these measures to use it was
  neccessary to
  1) categorise the different techniques
  2) specified some very broad criteria
- and so i was able to select 6 measures from 4 theorists that seemed
  to most suitable for use descriptive tonal models.
- then computed tables of values for all pairs of SCs
** Analysed chord dictionary
- analysing the values produced by comparisons between standard chord
  types for example those used in chord estimation algorithms for
  mirex.
- See plot
* To Do
** Selection of repetior
- what chords occur in different types of rerpetoire for example early
  polyphony.
- which measures handle or best descriminate between these chord
  types.
** Visualisation of repertoire
- integration into Agustins framework for tonal analysis
- Class-scapes:
- can act as a test bench
