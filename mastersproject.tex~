TITLE: Evaluation of Pitch-Class Set Similarity Measures for Tonal Analysis
\subsection{Motivation}
\label{sec-2-1}
\begin{itemize}
\item there are many of these measure from mathematics and pitch class set theory but their practical value is not well known outside highly theoretical circles
\item in MIR for example the more commonly used similarity measures have little or no musical or perceptual relevance for example euclidean distance
\item many people in MIR and other areas might be put off by the apparent complexity of this mathematics
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Goal}
\label{sec-2-2}
\begin{itemize}
\item the goal is to therefore provide some characterisation of these measures that is widely relevant to many applications in tonal analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodology}
\label{sec-2-3}
\begin{itemize}
\item the way this will be done will be first to thoroughly survey all the relevant techniques and specific capabilities
\item then to look closely at their implicit pitch-spaces via MDS
\item this is a method of mapping a geomtric spaces based on the relative distance between a collection of objects
\item most important will be to try and find low dimensional projections of these spaces for visualisation (which is always a useful thing)
\item and also to characterise the local stress of these projections, so how distorted do they become when you reduce the dimensionality
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation}
\label{sec-2-4}
\begin{itemize}
\item finally for evaluation it will be necessary to try and use these spaces for some analysis.
\item so, I will attempt to integrate them with the work that Agustin has been doing and his framework for tonal analysis
\item and with this we can perform case studies using real musical examples that already have been subjected to some analysis so we have something to reference and compare with with
\end{itemize}
\section{Similarity Measures}
\label{sec-3}
\subsection{intro}
\label{sec-3-1}
\begin{itemize}
\item the problem of how to assess similarity of pc-set-classes
\item variety of similarity measures have been proposed over the years (\texttt{see the list})
\begin{itemize}
\item and arguments about the merits of these measures now occupy a number of journal pages.
\item Surveys/critiques of most measures can be found in \texttt{Castren}, \texttt{Isaacson}, and \texttt{Scott \& Isaacson}
\end{itemize}
\item Some fundamental questions remain unresolved:
\begin{enumerate}
\item What constitutes a "good" measure of pcset similarity?
\begin{itemize}
\item one that mirrors our "musical intuitions"?
\item See \texttt{Quinn, 2001} and \texttt{Isaacson, 1996} for discussion of issues
\end{itemize}
\item what musical properties does each function measure?
\begin{itemize}
\item this question is more readily amenable to analysis and should be answered first
\item This question is approached by \texttt{Samplaski}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{MDS on Pcsets using distance function}
\label{sec-4}
\begin{itemize}
\item resulting geometries will tell us something about what properties of pcsets the functions are measuring
\item if the geometries produced by different functions match up save for rotation, translation, or reflection, then,
\begin{itemize}
\item either a) measuring the same constructs, whatever those might be
\item or b) measuring constructs that, while different, are themselves functions of some other underlying construct(s)
\end{itemize}
\item Only such functions as give distinct proximity/distance ratings can be so evaluated (not \texttt{Rn})
\item interval-class vector or subset
\item matrices of ratings will be symmetrical
\begin{itemize}
\item configurations might be reflections or rotations of each other
\item require a reference function to compare with
\item use simplest MDS which is result-invariant with respect to axial reflection and rotation
\item Procrustes rotation (\texttt{Samplaski} paragraph 28)
\end{itemize}
\item no noise
\begin{itemize}
\item measures are formal abstract functions
\end{itemize}
\item dimensionality of solutions depends on how many data points \texttt{samplaski} paragraph 33
\end{itemize}

\item ANGLE

\texttt{Mapping the Geometries of Pitch-Class Set Similarity Measures via Multidimensional Scaling}
\subsection{methodology}
\label{sec-15-1}
\begin{itemize}
\item 6 pcset similarity measures investigated
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{3 interval based}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{ANGLE}
\item \texttt{IcVSIM}
\item \texttt{ISIM2}
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{3 subset based} use subset embedding
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{RECREL}
\item \ref{sec-12-3}
\item \ref{sec-12-2}
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{3 cardinalities} under \hyperref[sec-23-7]{Tn/I}-equivelance
\begin{itemize}
\item trichords: 3
\item tetrachords: 4
\item pentachords: 5
\item ratings for each cardinality of set-class separately as well as contiguously grouped together (3+4, 4+5, 3+4+5) were studied
\end{itemize}
\item \ref{sec-23-19} applied to matrices of (dis)similarities
\item based on goodness-of-fit analysis\ldots{}
\begin{itemize}
\item four-dimensional geometric solutions were found for the icv-based measure
\item five-dimensional solutions were found for the subset based measures
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{motivation}
\label{sec-15-2}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Visualisation
\begin{itemize}
\item similarity measures yield alot of data
\end{itemize}
\item not satisfied with \texttt{scott and isaacoson} conclusions about correlation
\begin{itemize}
\item correlations (as single, all-subsuming numbers for pairs of measures) do nothing to show what constructs might underlie the ratings being produced.
\end{itemize}
\item geometric visualisation allows a "reality check"
\begin{itemize}
\item there might be problems with a measure's numerical ratings that are not evident from inspection of them
\end{itemize}
\item \texttt{see here}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Conclusions}
\label{sec-15-3}
The overall results are generally consistent with the idea that these functions all measure constructs relating to familiar scales (diatonic, hexatonic, octatonic, etc.). The results are also compared with several systems of pcset genera. ISIM2 was found to be inconsistent with itself in terms of the geometries it produced. Several set-classes had coordinates near zero along various dimensions in the derived configurations, indicating that in a formal quantitative sense they do not possess the corresponding musical properties being measured; this may raise questions concerning the relative aesthetic worth of some such set-classes.

\item The ways in which we are accustomed to talking about similarity relations are not as productive as they seem to be, and there are better ways to do it.

\item HPCP
\item mirchromagram (MIR toolbox for matlab)(Lartillot \& Toiviainen, 2007)
\end{itemize}
\item Pitch profiles are reduced to one octave (pitch-class)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Mutiscale Segmentation}
\label{sec-20-2}

\begin{itemize}
\item Adaptation of methods used in 
\begin{itemize}
\item (Gomez, 2006)
\item (Sapp, 2005)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Chroma Segmentation and Symmetrisation}
\label{sec-20-3}

\begin{itemize}
\item Each segment gives a pitch-cass profile
\item output for midi and audio is 2-D matrix containing the multi-scale pitch-class-distribution time series.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Key Estimation}
\label{sec-20-4}

\begin{itemize}
\item KK key finding algorithm
\begin{itemize}
\item correlate pitch-class profile with ring-shifted versions of KK profiles
\end{itemize}
\item Output is 24-D of key strengths
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Projection of estimates in pitch-space}
\label{sec-20-5}

\begin{itemize}
\item 24-D estimates of all frames are projected in a space of inter-key distances
\item 2 methods are used
\begin{enumerate}
\item multidimensional unfolding (Krumhansl, 1990)
\begin{itemize}
\item finds tonal centroid in 2-D KK space (angle based)
\end{itemize}
\item Compare pitch-class profile with SOM trained with the 24 KK profiles
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Colouring method}
\label{sec-20-6}

\begin{itemize}
\item Sapp, 2005 maps categorical keys to colours
\item this must be adapted to the continuous pitchspace
\begin{itemize}
\item unique colour for each position
\item perceptual difference between colours according to difference
\item smooth continuity across double circularity of torus
\end{itemize}
\item CIELAB is a perceptual colour space
\end{itemize}
\subsection{representing keyscape}

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Ambiguity}
\label{sec-20-8}

\subsubsection{Type I}
\label{sec-20-8-1}

\textbf{Space Suffices}

\begin{itemize}
\item Projections in pitch space not subject to high stress
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Type II}
\label{sec-20-8-2}

\textbf{Space does not suffice}

\begin{itemize}
\item stress induced by the unfolding method is too large
\item produces meaningless centroids

\item estimation method could provide a reasonable description of segment in 12-D
\item but the torus surface does not suffice for representing estimations as a single point

\item when segments PC profile doesnt strongly correlate with kk profiles
\end{itemize}

segments cannot be considered as tonal with respect to the key categories and their neighbouring differences
\subsubsection{More on Ambiguity}
\label{sec-20-8-3}

\begin{enumerate}
\item (Temperly, 2008)
\label{sec-20-8-3-1}

\begin{itemize}
\item "tonal clarity": relative strength between most probable and second most probable
\item does not consider the viscinity of involved candidates
\item "tonalness": temperly's definition of tonalness is appropriate for \textbf{type 1}

\item extreme abiguity: low clarity and tonalness
\item corresponds to \textbf{type II}

\item mirkeyclarity from MIR Toolbox is similar to SOM activations for confidence scapes
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Set class description}
\label{sec-20-10-1}

\begin{itemize}
\item Unordered pitch-class set/pc-set
\item interval classes (ignoring direction)
\item interval vector (6-D data structure)

\item class equivelance: Two arbitrary pc-sets are equivelant if they belong to the same class

\item cardinality: the number of elements in a set (the simplest equivelance but not useful)
\item interval vector equivelance: groups pc-sets sharing same interval vector
\item 197 different iv types: can describe any segment of music
\item transpositional set class: (Tn-equivelance)share similar sonority in many musical contexts (348 types)
\item inversion/transpositional set-class: TnI equivelance
\end{itemize}

\section{GLOSSARY}
\label{sec-23}
\subsection{pc}
\label{sec-23-1}
PITCH-CLASS. A set of all pitches that are enharmonically identical and/or related by any number of octaves. There are twelve pcs, numbered from 0 to 11. pc 0 contains all C naturals, all B sharps, all D double-flats; pc 1 contains all Dbs, all C\#s; pc 2 contains all Ds, all C\#\#s, all Ebbs, and so forth-pc 11 which contains all Bs, A\#\#s, and Cbs.
From \texttt{Morris}

\subsection{ic}
\label{sec-23-2}
INTERVAL CLASS. A set of all interval that differ by multiples of 12 semi-tones and/or are complementary respect with to the octave. There are six ics, numbered
from 1 to 6. ic 1 contains all minor 2nds, all major 7ths, all diminished octaves, all augmented 8ves, all min 9ths, etc.; ic 2 contains all major 2nds, all dim 3rds, all aug 6ths, all min 7ths, all maj 9ths,etc. -and so forth-ic 6 contains all tritones, and intervals of a tritone plus any amount of octaves. The ic may also be defined as the set of intervals between any of the members of one pc and any of the members of another. The intervals between any D \# and any F are all members of ic 2.
From \texttt{Morris}

\subsection{set}
\label{sec-23-3}
An unordered collection of pcs without replication. The set (0,3,4) is the same as (0,4,3) and (4,3,0), etc. A particular set may be denoted by a capital letter. For instance, T = (0,3,4). There are 4,096 distinct sets.
From \texttt{Morris}

\subsection{SC}
\label{sec-23-4}
SET-CLASS. A collection of sets related to one another by Tn and/or I.
From \texttt{Morris}

\subsection{Tn}
\label{sec-23-5}
Tn TRANSPOSITION by 'n' semitones 'higher'. To transpose a set we add n to each pc in the set; if the sum exceeds 11, we reduce it by 12. If the set (8,5,7) is subjected to T5, the result is 8+5, 5+5, and 7+5 or (1,10,0). If W=(8,5,7), then (1,10,0) may be written T5W.
From \texttt{Morris}

\subsection{I}
\label{sec-23-6}
INVERSION. An operation on pcs which sends, 1 to 11 and vice- versa, 2 to 10 and the reverse, 3 to 9, 4 to 8, 5 to 7, while 0 and 6 remain the same. The inversion of the set (6,8,4,3) is (6,4,8,9) (and vice-versa). If (6,8,4,3) = D, then ID = (6,4,8,9).
From \texttt{Morris}

\subsection{TnI}
\label{sec-23-7}
Inversion followed by transposition. T5I of (7,9.4) is produced by taking the inversion which is (5,3,8) and transposing it by T5 which results in (10,8,1). If our original set is L, then T5IL= (10,8,1).
From \texttt{Morris}

\subsection{Invariance}
\label{sec-23-8}
A set is invariant if it remains unchanged after transformation under Tn or I or both. T4I of the set H which is (3,1,8) results in invariances since 3 becomes 9+4 or 1, 1 becomes 11+4 or 3, and 8 becomes 4+4 or 8. We say that our set is invariant under T4I. T4H= H
From \texttt{Morris}

\subsection{V}
\label{sec-23-9}
INTERVAL-CLASS-VECTOR. A listing of the amount of ics of each type in a particular set. V(Y) is the interval-class-vector associated with the set Y. A V is an array of six numbers square brackets. The first number is called V1 and gives the amount of ic Is in the set; the second number or argument, V2, is the number of ic 2s in the set; etc., to the sixth argument, V6, which gives the number of ic 6s. In the expression, V(B) = [1,1,1,0,0,0], we are asserting the set B has one ic 1, one ic 2, one ic 3, and no ic 4, 5, or 6. The set (5,7,8) could be B. We may determine the V of any set by examining all pairs of pcs in the set, finding the ic for each pair, and registering it in the appropriate argument in the array. If the set R is (8,4,2,0) the ic for 8 and 4 is 4; the ic for 8 and 2 is 6; the ic for 8 and 0 is 4; the ic for 4 and 2 is 2; for 4 and 0 we have 4 and for 2 and 0 we have 2. Thus, V(R) = [0,2,0,3,0,1].
From \texttt{Morris}

\subsection{\#R}
\label{sec-23-10}
Where R is a set, \#R denotes its cardinality, is, the number that of pcs in R.
From \texttt{Morris}

\subsection{\#(V)R}
\label{sec-23-11}
The number of ics in V(R). Where R contains n pcs (n = \#R), 4V(R) is equal to the sum of whole numbers starting with 1 and ending with (n-1). A set of seven pcs has 1+2+3+4+5+6 or 21 ics.
From \texttt{Morris}

\subsection{Membership $\in$}
\label{sec-23-12}
5 $\in$ (8,5,7) d $\in$ R (a pc named d is a member of the set R). 
From \texttt{Morris}

\subsection{Inclusion $\subset$}
\label{sec-23-13}
R $\subset$ T if every pc in set R is also in set T (R is a sub-set of T).
(7,5,8) $\subset$ (8,5,3,7,0)
From \texttt{Morris}

\subsection{| x | (Absolute Value)}
\label{sec-23-14}
Take the positive sign of the expression enclosed in Is. | 5 | = 5; | -7 | = (+)7; | 7-2 | = | 2-7 |.
From \texttt{Morris}

\subsection{Genera}
\label{sec-23-15}
\begin{itemize}
\item classical
\begin{itemize}
\item an object either belongs or does not
\end{itemize}
\item fuzzy
\begin{itemize}
\item an object has a probability of belonging
\end{itemize}
\item many genera systems have been proposed
\begin{itemize}
\item Ericksson, 1986
\item \texttt{Forte, 1988}
\item \texttt{Parks, 1989}
\item \texttt{Quinn, 1997}
\item \texttt{Quinn, 2001}
\end{itemize}
\item Some dont relate directly to pcsets: e.g., Hanson, 1960; Harris, 1989; Hindemith, 1937/42; Wolpert, 1951, 1972
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Z-Relation}
\label{sec-23-16}
\begin{itemize}
\item Same icv but not related by TnI
\end{itemize}

\subsection{robustness}
\label{sec-23-17}
\begin{itemize}
\item whether changing the set of objects being compared alters the perceived/computed similarity between the original set of objects.
\item "yields consistent relative MDS geometries, save for scaling, regardless of surrounding context" \texttt{samp} paragraph 21
\item \texttt{Samplaski} tested robustness of similarity measures by analysing cardinalities in isolation as well as combinations of contiguous cardinalities
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Significance}
\label{sec-23-18}
\begin{itemize}
\item the probability that the observed result might have occurred by chance
\item \texttt{Samplaski} paragraph 27
\end{itemize}

\subsection{MDS}
\label{sec-23-19}
\subsubsection{non-metric MDS}
\label{sec-23-19-1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Shepard (1962), Kruskal (1964a, 1964b)
\item assumes that the distance or proximity values of the matrix are directly related by some unknown function to distances between the objects in some underlying abstract N-dimensional Euclidean space, whose distance metric is the generalized version of the formula familiar from Cartesian geometry, SQRT(x2 + y2 + z2 + \ldots{}).
\item distances are symmetric
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Issues}
\label{sec-23-19-2}
\begin{enumerate}
\item how do we determine the best \ref{sec-23-19-6}?
\begin{itemize}
\item important to minimize the number of dimensions
\begin{itemize}
\item for visualisation
\item and parsiomony of explanation
\begin{itemize}
\item as the number of free parameters increases there become too few constraints on the possible configuration.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item For a given dimensionality, we obtain two values: \hyperref[sec-23-19-3]{stress} and \ref{sec-23-19-4}
\item the number of objects should be at least 3-4 times greater than the highest anticipated dimensionality. \texttt{samplaski} paragraph 17
\end{itemize}
\item inherent underlying \hyperref[sec-23-19-7]{asymmetries}?
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{samplaski} paragraph 12
\item a number of models for dealing with this
\begin{itemize}
\item \ref{sec-23-19-10}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item \ref{sec-23-19-8}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Stress}
\label{sec-23-19-3}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{goodness of fit measure}
\item Discrepancies between the actual data values and the derived underlying distances are accounted for in a goodness-of-fit measure called "stress": as the number of dimensions increases, stress decreases, and choosing between configurations of different dimensionalities becomes an issue. (Samplaski)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{r2}
\label{sec-23-19-4}
\begin{itemize}
\item r-squared
\item percentage of the variability of the data being explained by the solution
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{elbows}
\label{sec-23-19-5}
\begin{itemize}
\item plot the stress and r2 values for several dimensionalities
\item look for "elbows" (inflection points) in the plots.
\item If an elbow exists, then the higher-dimensional solutions are not giving significant additional explanation--the plot suddenly flattens out.
\item \texttt{samplaski} paragraph 17
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{dimensionality}
\label{sec-23-19-6}
\begin{itemize}
\item choose dimensionality on the bases of clarity and logical interpretation.
\item one dimension above or below "optimal" as indicated by the stress/r2 values might be better:
\begin{enumerate}
\item if there is a clear interpretation given an added dimension; or
\item if one configuration is easier to visualize (e.g 3-D vs 4-D solution),
\begin{itemize}
\item especially in a situation where it is unclear what can be gained in explanatory power by using the extra dimension.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{asymmetry}
\label{sec-23-19-7}
-poor fit can be caused by several factors

\subsubsection{Exemplars}
\label{sec-23-19-8}
\begin{itemize}
\item In an MDS analysis of N objects, one of which is an exemplar, the only way to minimize distortion (i.e., stress) is to place the exemplar at the center of the configuration and arrange the other objects around it.
\item \texttt{samplaski} note 15
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{INDSCAL}
\label{sec-23-19-9}
\begin{itemize}
\item deals with idiosyncrasies of subjects ratings
\item takes one matrix per subject
\item \texttt{samplaski} paragraph 13
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{ASCAL}
\label{sec-23-19-10}
\begin{itemize}
\item deals with possible asymmetries underlying the data
\item \texttt{samplaski} paragraph 14
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{CA}
\label{sec-23-19-11}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{cluster analysis}
\item (Tversky, 1977; Tversky and Gati, 1982; Tversky and Hutchinson, 1986)
\item helps with problem of highly seperable dimensions
\item There is a family of CA models, but they all work similarly: given a proximity or distance matrix, some method is used to pick the pair of objects most like each other, group them into a single cluster, and derive a new reduced matrix. When the process is finished, the objects will be grouped into a binary tree structure (exactly two branches descend from each node, and the objects are "leaves" at the termini of the final branches), where the distance between any pair of objects is related to the length of the path along the branches separating them.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{PMDS}
\label{sec-23-19-12}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Probabalistic MDS}
\item \texttt{Samplaski} paragraph 23
\item assumed there is euclidean space
\item onjects are probability distributions
\item variance
\item PMDS is a technique still under development (2005)
\item \ref{sec-21-2}
\end{itemize}
\section{Toroidal space}

\subsection{Krumhansl Kessler}
\label{sec-24-1}

\begin{itemize}
\item Measure tonal stability
\item Probetone technique
\item obtained 12-D key profiles
\item compute inter-key correlations
\item matrix of dissimilarities fed a
\item non-metric multi-dimensional scaling algorithm (Shepard, 1962)
\item found optimal euclidean solution in 4-D (4-D KK space)
\item minimised stress between dissimilarities and spacial distances
\item Two circular structures stand out
\item 4-D KK space can be though of as 3-D toroidal surface (3-D KK space)
\item Unfold toroidal surface to get 2-D KK space
\item Each dimensional reduction results in a distortion
\end{itemize}

These spaces are assumed to represent internalised knowledge about tonal hierarchies so can be used for testing models of tonal induction

\item Any segment can be projected into the space so as to find the closeness to the categories
\item 4-D space is a fixed scaffold
\item multidimensional unfolding technique (Coombs, 1964)
